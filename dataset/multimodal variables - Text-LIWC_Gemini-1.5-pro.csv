 Speaker2: [00:00:28] We started Health Warrior after reading a best selling book, Born to Run and a best selling book, The Omnivore's Dilemma. And in Born to Run, we were inspired by the Tarahumara. We were inspired by the story of chia seeds and nutrient dense superfood, and we went from that to inventing the chia bar because most packaged food is junk food. It's been a wonderful adventure. But what's so great about this trip is we get to go back to where it all began. We're on the famous L-shaped train. We're going to visit the Tarahumara. The Tarahumara are a tribe that really lived remotely, almost lost in the Copper Canyons of Mexico. You may know them as the world's most famous ultramarathoners. They run 25, 50, 100 miles a day, largely without shoes on. They also happen to live very close to the land. So it's really one of the most untouched cultures in the world. But they also have some modern challenges that they're facing, particularly due to climate change and drought.
 

 Speaker3: [00:01:22] These drastic changes in the environment have caused unfortunate hardships for the locals.

 Speaker3: [00:01:44] This year, we were able to help Silvino and his friend Mikhail get the chia harvest back to its former glory. With their hard work on the crop, they were able to feed 12 families from the village. Mickey, an honorary Tarahumara has been living with the tribe for decades and has been a valuable resource with this important first crop.
 

 Speaker5: [00:02:05] Through the support of Health Warrior, we have been able to offer jobs to people in an area where there are absolutely no jobs. So this is offering a really unique opportunity and a very much needed one. And that's why I think this has been and could continue to be a very good project that would make a significant difference in an entire culture.
 

 Speaker3: [00:02:30] Now, Health Warrior is giving back by investing in the Tarahumaras first commercial chia harvest, reintroducing a seed that had disappeared from their diet, and creating an economic lifeline for the tribe. The product is a new Mexican chocolate chia bar, with sales benefiting the Tarahumara and the work of Operation Farm and Run.

 Speaker1: [00:00:01] Mommy, is it Christmas yet?
 

 Speaker2: [00:00:12] Do you remember this excitement? I remember when I was a child. I ran that into the kitchen and opened a new window in my advent calendar each morning and ate the chocolate. But as I grew up eating, the same low quality milk chocolates just got very boring. I looked around and asked, why isn't there an advent calendar with just better quality chocolates? I couldn't find one so I decided to make my own. I filled my advent calendar with all the different Kraft chocolates I gathered throughout the year. I posted them on social media and everyone really liked the idea. So I wanted to share this experience with as many people as possible. This year, I decided to create the very first mixed Kraft Chocolate Advent Calendar, showcasing 24 different makers from around the world with their 24 different chocolates made in a small batch, ethical and sustainable way. This calendar will bring you joy each day by letting you discover the wonderful diversity of chocolate flavors through various cacao origins. Do you want to join me in this exciting journey? Please support my Kickstarter campaign to help me realize this special advent calendar. Share it with friends and family, and make a pledge to receive one of the 200 limited edition advent calendars and other fun rewards, such as tasting packs and even group tasting sessions. You can find more information about the project below. Thank you for watching.

 Speaker1: [00:00:00] Hi, I'm Robin Dochterman. I'm a chocolatier who opened my own chocolate shop about two years ago. The shop is in a little village of Marine on Saint Croix, Minnesota, and it's about 45 minutes northeast of the Twin Cities. We make all our own chocolates here. We make them from scratch, and we're big believers in sourcing our ingredients locally. So we use organic cream and butter. That's from a family farm and dairy that's about ten miles away. We also use local honey and maple syrup and fruits in season. So a while back I was doing a little market research. Okay, I was eating one of those really thin, trendy chocolate bars, and I had an idea. I thought, why not use a chocolate bar as a canvas for art? So I talked to Laura McCall. Laura is a clay tile artist and I love her work. I have some of it hanging in my own house, and I asked Laura if she would carve us a couple of tiles that we could then turn into chocolate bar bowls. So I think a really special mold like this deserves to be filled with a stellar chocolate. Fortunately, there's a craft chocolate company out of San Francisco that makes wonderful organic chocolate. They actually work with cacao farmers in Peru to make better tasting beans so the farmers win. The chocolate is fabulous and that's what I've chosen to fill the the bar molds with. Finally, I wanted to package these chocolate bars in a way that when you were done eating the chocolate, when you were done enjoying it, you wouldn't just crumple up the paper and toss it in the trash. I wanted to be able to put it in a box that you could keep, that you could put other things in.
 

 Speaker1: [00:01:45] Also, there weren't any off the shelf boxes that would fit the way the chocolate is dimensional. So unlike flat bars where you can just put it in a little cardboard sleeve, these actually have some dimension. So we did the creative thing and we made a box. Artisans in the Philippines then hand make these boxes from the design. And the result is a really handsome keepsake box. So not only will you not crumple it up and toss it in the trash when you're done enjoying the chocolate, but it's the kind of thing you would want to put jewelry in or ticket stubs from the last concerts you've been to, and you'd probably feel good about regifting it to one final partner. We need to be able to get these special bars out into the world is you. It might be a really good project for you if you like chocolate, art, nature, birds, farmers, small business, local global collaborations, good food. I mentioned chocolate. We plan to use the help of our backers to actually get our first box order underway, and then get them delivered to us so we can fill them with sensual, delicious, happy making chocolate and get them on their way to fans, the press, and the world. We really appreciate your help and we're offering some sweet, decadent rewards. I bet by now you've figured out it's chocolate. We hope to get the boxes by Earth Day, so this is a pretty short campaign, so we'd be especially appreciative if you would be willing to help spread the word to the chocolate loving community by sharing this video, this campaign, with your friends as well. Thank you very much.",89.26,10,24,0.65,8,10

 Speaker1: [00:00:08] I am a professional pastry chef. I work full time at a restaurant and then in my spare time, I own my own business. I make hand-painted artisan chocolates, cupcakes, wedding cakes, specialty cakes, really anything anybody can imagine, I can, I can create for them. This is my home office, if you will. Right now, what I need is just a commercial kitchen to work from. I'm very limited. I can't sell to retail. I would love to grow and in order to grow, I need to have a commercial kitchen that I can sell from. Right now I have a very small tempering machine. It only allows me to do about 2 or 3 molds at a time, which you know, is anywhere from 50 to 60 pieces given. And I would love to get a professional tempering machine that instead of a £2 batch, I can do a 10 to £12 batch of chocolates, which would drastically cut down my time and allow me to do much more production a lot faster. My Mario and Luigi cake is one of my favorites I've ever made. Within two days you need to bake, cool, cut, fill, frost and then decorate. So it's a long process, but it has to be done in a short amount of time. The Mario cake probably took me four hours, four and a half, five hours. If I do or do not get this money. I'm still going to keep working as hard as I have been, and even harder to get to my ultimate goal. I love what I do. I can do this. I want everyone who buys my chocolates to have the same experience of joy that I have when I create them. Simply be who you are. I am a chocolatier.

 Speaker1: [00:00:07] I am a fully fledged, you know, commercial kitchen in my basement. It's well under 200ft². Like, I'll talk to people sometimes, like. Yeah. You know, like our our factory is only 1500ft². Like, I just don't know how we do it. I'm like, oh, my gosh, 1500 square feet. I could how much chocolate could I make in 1500 square feet? Several years ago, my older brother had gone to this really cool chocolate snobbery 101 course in Salt Lake City, and I'm like, I'll try it. But I have a terrible palate and I don't like dark chocolate, but I'll try it. You know, obviously I was horribly mistaken. I just fell in love with it, started doing tastings for friends, and one of them was like, hey, we should try making this stuff. To which I essentially thought, that's the craziest thing I've ever heard. Which is totally true. I mean, it's totally the craziest thing I've ever heard, but here I am. Actually, we started right here in this kitchen. So you can actually make some really decent chocolate with very little added equipment. You can roast the cocoa beans in your home oven. You can crack them with a rolling pin. You can put the cracked beans in a bowl and get like a hair dryer or a fan, and kind of just blow all the husks away. We didn't know what we were doing. I mean, but at the time we tried it and we're like, this isn't bad. Like, this is, you know, for our first batch. Holy crap. You know, in fact, that first bar was well, it was a finalist in that year's Good Food Awards, which was kind of this insane moment because I'm like, all right. So a year ago, I had, like, not even really tasted chocolate. And now, you know, I won this award.
 

 Speaker2: [00:01:38] So we decided to move everything to the basement from the kitchen.
 

 Speaker1: [00:01:41] Very, very quickly because, well, the kitchens, the kitchen, and you've got this machine running for, you know, 24 hours a day, 3 to 4 days a week, you know, is the wife doesn't allow that for too long. I'm all across the country. I've got a pretty decent base here in the DC area. And the first batch we made probably 2 or £3 worth of chocolate which, you know, if you're making a two ounce bar, that's like eight bars a pound. My current roaster can roast £12, maybe £15 if I push it at a time. And so I'm building a new roaster that will easily be able to do like the £50 or whatever that I need for for one batch. I've gone through a lot of jobs. I mean, I sold cars for a little while, which did not go well. I used to wash carpets, I used to roof, and then I stumbled into a computer job. And actually, that's still what I do is my day job is Linux systems administration as my day job. Finding the balance, you know, certainly with the day job and and the and the chocolate is pretty tough. I've got a wife, I've got four kids, I've got a mortgage and car payments and all that crap, you know. So I mean, nothing gives a crap. And there's a lot of times that I'll have to say, well, I was going to do this chocolate, but I, you know, my daughter has a viola concert, you know, so I'm going to do that at this point, other than storage, like, there's not there's not a huge rush to move out. And so once, once I move out of the basement, then there's a lot more overhead and that kind of thing. And so like, I don't know that I'd say that I'm going to hold on to the basement as long as I can, but I'm going to hold on to it for a little while.",25.97,10,14,2.17,10,10

 Speaker1: [00:00:10] This isn't any old health bar. This is an all natural, all organic grub bar made from cricket flour. We're a start up company called grub. We've been busy hosting pop up events and creating products such as our Cricket nut fudge. Our mission is to convince the UK public that insects are good food in every way.
 

 Speaker2: [00:00:29] Our bar is a gluten and nut free recipe. We've selected eight ingredients which all work in harmony to make our bar something special. All of these are really high in fibre, high in protein, give you lots of energy and taste great. Lastly, our secret ingredient cricket flour. This is 63% protein and in fact has more protein than a steak. And it tastes great.
 

 Speaker1: [00:00:50] They've eaten all over the world. They pack a serious nutritional punch, but most importantly, they taste pretty damn good. But don't take our word for it. Here's what some totally random people had to say about our grub bar.
 

 Speaker3: [00:01:03] Give us your initial reaction. Taste. Flavours.
 

 Speaker4: [00:01:05] Pretty tasty. Okay. Nice chocolate. Pretty orangey. Good.
 

 Speaker5: [00:01:11] Some sort of nuts in there?
 

 Speaker3: [00:01:13] That's right. Yeah.
 

 Speaker5: [00:01:14] Oh. That's lovely. It feels quite Substantial.
 

 Speaker6: [00:01:19] It's a lot of nice flavors.
 

 Speaker4: [00:01:21] It tastes like coconut. It's not very strong.
 

 Speaker5: [00:01:23] It actually feels like a treat.
 

 Speaker6: [00:01:25] It's nice that it's got the chocolate with it as well.
 

 Speaker4: [00:01:28] Nice and chewy. It's not too heavy.
 

 Speaker7: [00:01:30] It tastes like a normal chocolate bar.
 

 Speaker4: [00:01:31] A nice texture. It looks very healthy.
 

 Speaker3: [00:01:34] Okay.
 

 Speaker5: [00:01:34] Are you going to tell me what it is or not? Insects don't like cricket flour. I wouldn't have guessed that. I didn't expect that. It's nice though. I think it's just a psychological barrier you have with the word cricket. No, it's really good, actually. I'm not really sure whether I'm freaked out by that.
 

 Speaker6: [00:01:57] That's really unexpected.
 

 Speaker3: [00:02:00] Would you buy them again? I would.
 

 Speaker6: [00:02:01] Yeah. I think I'm actually okay with that. Do you like the taste?
 

 Speaker3: [00:02:06] Do you want to take some with you? Would you buy it again? Yeah.
 

 Speaker5: [00:02:10] I'm going to finish this right now. Sounds great. I can't wait to see you guys launch it.
 

 Speaker1: [00:02:16] The proof is in the pudding. Crickets are high in protein, calcium and iron. All the essentials of making the perfect health food bar.

 Speaker1: [00:00:02] Hi Kickstarter, thanks for checking out my project. I'm Dave and I'm here to share with you something that I think is pretty sweet. About two years ago I needed some room for my other business, so I rented a retail space where I live in downtown Hillsboro, Oregon. I built a kitchen in the back and in the front. I decided to open up a chocolate shop and follow one of my passions through a lot of trial and error, customer feedback, and a lot of fun, we're going to focus on what I know we're doing really well and really uniquely. I've now been creating over 200 unique and delicious chocolate bars using some of the highest quality dried fruits, roasted and candied nuts, and amazing candy combinations to make really fun, delicious and unique flavors. Some examples are all the dried fruits and nuts you could think of, classic bars of turtles and s'mores and gummy bears. Some of the more unique stuff like peanut butter and jelly, popping cotton candy bars, matcha green tea, coconut curry, ghost pepper, Aztec bars, and a lot, lot more. We have a lot of dairy free, gluten free, as well as vegan friendly options. I'm here for your support in launching the business online.
 

 Speaker1: [00:01:07] We need to order large quantities of this customized gift box that you're going to be able to have in a beautiful design. You can look below in the descriptions and see what it'll actually look like. You're going to be able to go online and order a four, eight, or 12 piece gift box customized for whatever your personal flavor is, or choose for some of the best sellers or more popular stuff that I've already selected. We also need to order larger chocolate tempering machines, as well as freezers and shipping equipment, so we can ship these in temperature controlled boxes nationwide year round. My goal is to provide amazing flavors of ethically sourced killer chocolate bars at a fair price in a fun, customizable gift box. We're also going to be donating a percentage of all of our profits to organizations that focus on sustainability, as well as a fair wage for all the cocoa farmers around the world. We're going to be taking feedback from all of our backers on seasonal, fun flavors for our stretch rewards. Let's do something really sweet together. Back to project.

 Speaker1: [00:00:00] Hi, I'm Carl with Intrigue Chocolate Company in Pioneer Square, downtown Seattle. Injury chocolate is a small artisan chocolate shop making a dark chocolate ganache of many different flavors that feature ingredients such as Szechuan pepper, pink peppercorn, rose petal, basil, cinnamon, nutmeg, etc.. This, in fact, is Aaron's toolbox. Aaron, give a wave. That's Aaron, the chocolatier. Injury chocolates has been around for about six years, and since that time we've found solutions to packaging the chocolate that were affordable for a small business. But that means using standardized packaging that isn't always, to everyone, the best impression that they want to give. When giving a gift of chocolate, we were faced with a challenge of creating a new logo and a new packaging look that communicated visually what you were going to taste inside of the box. So let me give you a little look at some of the designs that our two fantastic designers came up with. This is a hand wrapped, individually labeled solution for each truffle that shows the flavor of the chocolate that you're about to taste. This here is our two piece solution for weddings and corporate events. And on the inside it has a little fortune. This is our 12 piece custom assortment. It's got a nice brown look. The truffles will stack this way so you can see every flavor as they line up, like a bookshelf. And then you pull the small ribbon to pop the first one out of the box.
 

 Speaker1: [00:01:34] Take two of those boxes and combine them together to get your 24 piece gift. And as a special treat, we're adding to the lineup a roasted origin cacao bean that has a fantastic flavor, and we're very interested and very excited to share. We need 400 people to pre-order a box of chocolate in order to afford to print and cut all of these designs of packaging necessary 400 boxes gets us there, but if we can do 2000 boxes, then we'll also be able to hire intrigues first full time employee. That's an amazing feat for us. The thing about Kickstarter is that if we don't fund the minimum goal, then nobody gets the chocolate in this fancy new packaging. You can still come to our shop and buy the chocolate, but it's not going to be in these boxes until we're able to afford to print them. If you enjoy chocolate, now is a perfect time to pre-order and just imagine how excited you'll be in a few months when you receive the box in the mail and you get to tell that special friend that you're sharing it with all about how you supported a small business in their Kickstarter endeavor. Thank you very much. Sincerely from Carl and Aaron Bartel at Intrigue Chocolate Company. Have a nice day.",91.74,6,7,1.81,8,10

 Speaker1: [00:00:03] Hey, Max. What are we doing today?
 

 Speaker2: [00:00:05] Kickstarter. So we're in the Kelham Island area of Sheffield. Our current facility. We've been here for just over a year, and it's been a fantastic space to get us off the ground, but we're now looking to scale. There's actually only a handful of companies in the UK that do what we do, crafting chocolate from these into this, and the process is rather fittingly called Bean to Bar. And our award winning chocolate is stocked with some pretty cool places. Some friends of mine own a restaurant called The Milestone, which is literally just around the corner, and they knew I was on the lookout for a new space. So I got this phone call and they said they had something I might be interested in. I went to go and have a look and I was just blown away.
 

 Speaker3: [00:00:45] Hello, welcome to Cutlery Works. I'm Matt. This is Nina. And Cutlery Works is the largest independent food hall in the north of England. We have 12 kitchens, three bars, 300 people, and we look forward to opening later this year.
 

 Speaker2: [00:00:57] I mean, it's just an amazing space, isn't it? We're going to have a big window here, so guess the food all can see us in action. And we're going to be able to do tours and increase production. It's just fantastic opportunity. And then I got thinking being in this food hall, it seemed a shame not to offer some form of retail outlet for our chocolate. And then that light bulb moment happened. How amazing would it be if we could offer you our chocolate and not just our bars, but through a variety of baked goods and beverages that really showcase the different origins that we work with? Think gooey brownies, Moorish cookies, and the most velvet hot chocolate you've ever come across. Renowned globally for its steel, Sheffield has seen a wave of vibrancy in recent years, and a lot of that is to do with the redevelopment of this industrial area down here in Kelham, with big names such as the Arctic Monkeys and Richard Hawley recording down here, breweries on every corner, you know, something pretty special is going on, and we think a speciality chocolate cafe will be a welcome addition to the scene.
 

 Speaker4: [00:01:54] This area is fantastic for artisan producers. I make artisan cheese here. We've got the depot who to make artisan bread next door, and lots of other producers. We're really excited about Max moving around the corner, because he'll be closer to us and we can carry on collaborating on our product with his. So this is a cocoa dusted little mester.
 

 Speaker5: [00:02:13] When Max introduced himself to me and explained the concept of his Yorkshire chocolate, we thought the product was just fantastic. So creating a space where people can come and learn about the chocolate, to taste the chocolate, and also to experience the chocolate paired with a drink, with wine, with brandy, with whiskey is a fantastic opportunity that people will really get a lot out of.
 

 Speaker6: [00:02:33] We really like working with Max from bullion, and he'll come into the store and he'll hold tastings. The most recent one that we did was a rum tasting, which was fantastic. It was really well received by our customers. So I think to have a space where they can see him making the chocolate and try the chocolate. Taste of chocolate, it will be fantastic for him.
 

 Speaker2: [00:02:52] With our huge investment in the scaling of the new factory, we're in need of people far and wide to help bring this project to life. When you start putting together fit out costs and equipment for this sort of thing, you soon realize that it isn't going to be cheap. So we're looking to raise £10,000 to help cover these costs and to encourage your support with a range of fantastic rewards, which you can check out below. If we do it and raise the money, it would just be amazing. Imagine we're in the building where we could make this happen. The first Bullion Bean to bar cafe. And it'd be thanks to you guys and what an amazing achievement. So what you need to know is that if we don't hit our £10,000 target, the project won't be funded. So it really is all or nothing. And I would just love it if we could pull together and make this happen. I want you guys to be part of this journey. Thank you very much for watching. I hope you can see the vision for what we're trying to achieve here, and if you can support this, it would mean the absolute world to me. Thank you very much. Did we get that?

 Speaker1: [00:00:13] Hi, I'm Elaine. And I'm Matt. And we are chocolate. Chocolate. And maker of small batch chocolate. The word chocolate is actually the original word for a drink that Aztecs and Mayans drank centuries ago. It was made from ground cacao and water and spices, and it literally means bitter water. The term bean debar actually just means taking the cacao bean and grinding it down and making chocolate. So we import organically grown and sustainably harvested cacao from Central and South America and Madagascar.
 

 Speaker2: [00:00:54] So for us, the origins of chocolate go back to 2012 when we decided to quit our desk jobs, pack up the kids, and move to the jungles of Costa Rica. While we were there, we met locals who were growing cacao right in the rainforest and harvesting it and then grinding it down into chocolate in their factory, which was really more of a little shack on a hilltop looking out over the Caribbean.
 

 Speaker1: [00:01:18] And we said, we got to do this. So while we're in Costa Rica, we found this amazing community of locals and expats who were, by and large, just looking for a sustainable way of living. And we're looking for a connected community. And so we really want to replicate that, bring that to Atlanta in the form of chocolate.
 

 Speaker2: [00:01:42] So we make single origin dark chocolate, and we also do flavored chocolate. Like we have a milk chocolate that we actually use coconut milk. And we have a coconut milk and jerk spice bar. We have a Georgia pecan and ginger. And we do a mint chocolate chip in addition to a.
 

 Speaker1: [00:01:58] Lot of other things. And we made chocolate using just two ingredients organic cacao and an organic cane sugar. So we're actually naturally and deliciously soy and gluten free, and our bars are vegan. And we definitely think that knowing where your food comes from is important. And so we strive to make chocolate simply and transparently and with the with a love and a respect for the health of our consumers, our customers and our planet and the farmers that we buy our cacao from.
 

 Speaker2: [00:02:32] And we had our debut here in Atlanta a couple of weeks ago at the Inman Park Festival, and we had a great time. We met a lot of good people, and we actually ended up selling a lot of chocolate, and we, in fact sold out of most of our bars. And we were selling over the two day festival. We sold on average of a bar every other minute. And so we're ready to step up and bring you more great craft chocolate here in Atlanta. So we have been making chocolate in these really small grinders. These are little grinders that we've been using. And we've actually because we don't use any emulsifiers when we make our chocolate. It's really tough on these little machines. And we've actually burned through two of the three that we had in the build up to the Park festival.
 

 Speaker1: [00:03:17] So we need your help to raise $9,500. And that amount of money is going to help us to buy a much larger stone grinder. Went with the £65 capacity. And the ones that Matt showed you are £10. And so this will allow us to to make more than six times the amount of chocolate that we've been able to. And for your help and support, you will definitely get some great dark chocolate. And you can check out the rewards we're offering. So thank you for your interest and thank you for your support.",99,7,11,0.92,8,10

 Speaker1: [00:00:28] There are two things that I absolutely love keto and chocolate. I started making chocolate because I wanted to have a greater connection, a greater transparency to the food that I had access to. And when I moved to Colombia in 2014, I immediately saw that the virgin forests captivated me. The indigenous had been growing cacao there for thousands of years, and I knew this was a place where I could trust the food. My name is Danny Miklowitz. My father is actually a two time cancer survivor and my mom is a natural pharmacist. Seeing my mom change my father's diet as he was going through Chemotherapy. Seeing him eat an avocado a day now for six years, I knew that food could be medicine. It's clean here in this very factory. We learned step by step how to harness the power of cacao. Alternative sweeteners and nutrient rich nuts to really make the most nutrient dense foods we could find anywhere. And finally, with keto, we've been given an opportunity to utilize these amazing ingredients and transform it into a calling to serve this diet that has so many uses. When you truly understand the keto diet, it's like magic. People are able to think more mentally clearly, able to decrease rates of epilepsy in children, able to lose weight and kick a carbohydrate diet that they've had for for years.
 

 Speaker1: [00:02:04] That's kept them addicted and also reduce the rates of cancer through cell autophagy and fasting combined with the keto diet. With the experience that we have, the quality of our products is absolutely amazing and the Amazon is more of our backyard every single day. That means from the Brazil nuts that we use to the macadamias to Kopassus, which is this little known cousin of cacao. It's perfect for the keto diet. And even more, these good ingredients are super important from the heart of Colombia. This beautiful and joyous country. We need your help! We finished crafting recipes for these keto nut bars that are absolutely amazing using these Amazonian ingredients. And now we need to standardize them, scale them out, and cover them with keto dark chocolate. People absolutely love these bars and testing is done. And now we just need your help with our fundraising goal, so help us fulfill our mission. We're looking to help people who are interested in clean fats for a function, and we're trying to make it as transparent, precise, and delicious as possible so that your favorite things are keto and chocolate as well.",87.07,7,7,0.22,6,10

 Speaker1: [00:00:05] I'm Brian and I make chocolate. I'm the founder of Fruition Chocolate works and confectionery. Small bean to bar chocolate maker. We make chocolate straight from the cocoa bean. It's a very labor intensive process that very few craftspeople in the United States are undertaking. Great cocoa beans are the foundation of great chocolate. The process begins thousands of miles away in Central and South America and in other cocoa producing countries around the world. We try to find the best quality cocoa beans and turn it into really amazing chocolate. We do this in really small batches. First, we sort the cocoa beans. Then we carefully roast them. After we roast them, we crack the cocoa beans and remove the shell. Then. We stone grind the cocoa beans for about two days until the chocolate is very, very smooth. The chocolate then ages for several weeks to allow the flavours to balance. Next we mould it into bars. Or use it to create chocolates and other confections. We're working with some really amazing artists to produce custom molds and packaging to create kind of edible pieces of art based on their sculpture and design. We'll be using our really ridiculously awesome chocolate as the medium for these sculptures, for these little pieces of art. First, make a pledge to our Kickstarter campaign. Check out our website. Taste fruition.com and sign up for our mailing list. Tell all your friends about the project. Tell anybody you know who likes art? Who likes sculpture, who likes really, really, really delicious and amazing chocolate.",97.09,7,10,0.35,8,10

 Speaker1: [00:00:00] At Mill Creek Cacao Roasters. We are intimately involved in the art of making fine chocolate. Our goal is to craft an unsurpassed chocolate experience. We have selected a rare heritage cacao called Arriba Nacional. When it arrives direct from our farmer. We personally attend to the careful process of turning our Ecuadorian cacao into exquisite chocolate. We sort our cacao by hand to ensure every bean meets our very high standards. Having been in the coffee business for 20 years, we applied our knowledge of coffee and coffee roasting to the art of roasting cacao. Our modified coffee roaster allows us to roast the beans slowly, highlighting and unlocking their hidden flavors. The treasure of the bean is the nib. Nature's chocolate chip. To expose it, we crack the shell and then winnow the bean to separate the shell from the nib. The nib is then placed in a stone mill where it is milled for several days. The pressure and rotation transforms the nib into a chocolate liquor. As we continue to mill the nib, we add cane sugar and cocoa butter press from our farmer, giving the chocolate a luxuriously smooth taste and feel. Next, we pour the tempered chocolate into custom molds and cure it until the crystals are fully set. We pair our chocolate with carefully selected fruits and spices to bring unique flavor combinations. Each bar is then gently and carefully wrapped by hand. We hope you unwrap, taste and enjoy the experience. My name is Dana Brewster and.
 

 Speaker2: [00:01:39] I'm Mark Delvecchio, and.
 

 Speaker1: [00:01:41] We are Mill Creek Cacao Roasters, farm to bar chocolate makers.
 

 Speaker3: [00:01:48] We've had a blast making chocolate for the past three years, but there's even more excitement ahead.
 

 Speaker4: [00:01:53] After a year and a half of doing extensive R&D, we have developed a revolutionary method to aroma infuse our bars with flavor.
 

 Speaker3: [00:02:01] The mind blowing part is no additional flavor is actually added into the bar.
 

 Speaker4: [00:02:06] When you read the ingredients on the label, you'll find that there's cacao, pure cane sugar, cocoa butter, and pure Tahitian vanilla. That's it, that's it.
 

 Speaker3: [00:02:17] We take our heirloom dark chocolate bars and naturally cure them in a specialized environment filled with the essence of peppermint and raspberry.
 

 Speaker4: [00:02:27] It creates a unique flavor profile without actually adding anything to the chocolate, since chocolate is naturally receptive to aroma. The aroma infusion process requires a sensitive space.
 

 Speaker3: [00:02:38] We can create any flavor profile imaginable given the space.
 

 Speaker4: [00:02:42] We have unlimited imagination. We have limited space for creation. We need your help. We are out of it.
 

 Speaker3: [00:02:51] Space, that is. We need funds to help create a space that is ideal for this innovation.
 

 Speaker4: [00:02:58] We have imagined an entire line of a Roman infused bars, and we know you have great ideas to.

 Speaker1: [00:00:09] Hello. My name is Morag and this is Paz. And we're the founders of Bad Brownie.
 

 Speaker2: [00:00:15] Morgan. I used to work together, and instead of taking tea breaks or coffee breaks, we used to take hot chocolate breaks. And that kind of gives an idea. We both love chocolate. So three years ago, we gave up our jobs and we set bad brownie up. We thought, hang on, we've all had boring brownies before.
 

 Speaker1: [00:00:33] And we don't do boring.
 

 Speaker2: [00:00:34] Brownies. We do brownies with attitude. So we started baking in my tiny little kitchen, and we used to bake all the brownies ourselves, drive to the market in our rusty old Micra, and then sell them to all the people in Clapham who love them. So today we do loads of markets, we do online brownies and we do enough brownies every week. If you stack them end to end. Taunton, The Shard it's a lot of brownies.
 

 Speaker1: [00:00:55] So we are now ready for the next step. We want to open our first new bad brownie space in London.
 

 Speaker2: [00:01:02] Our mission is.
 

 Speaker1: [00:01:03] World domination by brownie.
 

 Speaker2: [00:01:05] Of course it's going to be a place of chocolate dreams. It's going to be amazing. So last year we had a plan to open a shop, but it was going to be a really small thing, you know, just selling chocolate brownies. But we thought, hang on, why don't we just do it bigger and better than that, we are planning to have dessert bar full of everything brownie related. We've got brownie cakes, we've got freakshakes chocolate brownie slices, obviously, and it's just going to be the most amazing dessert bar you can imagine. Completely dedicated to chocolate brownies. It's like a sugar coma. Yeah, but we need your help. All of this means that we need to spend a bit more on equipment than we thought. So we need your help to make our dreams come true. And yours? My favourite chocolate dream chocolate brownie flavour will make it for you. Put it across all our markets. We'll even name it.

 Speaker1: [00:00:49] At Indy Chocolate, we like to say we go from bean to bar and beyond. Of course, we sell our cocoa beans, our cocoa nibs and our chocolate to eat, but we have a lot of other fun things that we do. I started with our body care line, and those lotions and lip balms and soaps that we offer have real chocolate or cocoa butter in them. We also have our savory spice rubs, which have at least 52% cacao in them and are a great way to do everything from grilled vegetables and meats. And a lot of recipes we have online. We have our chocolate teas as well as our mixology line, so we can help you make your favorite drink even better. In 2008, I took my family to Belize, where I went to teach my kids how chocolate grows on trees, and that's really where my chocolate story began. Their curiosity and our learning together was really what made me decide to be a bean to bar chocolate maker. I started Indy Chocolate in 2010, and came into the market four years ago to make chocolate here in the market, but the space that I'm in doesn't allow me to do that, because there's not enough water and electricity here to really get a chocolate factory going. We look forward to bringing our transparent design into Pike Place Market, so you can watch the entire chocolate making process, from roasting beans all the way through to your finished bar. We want this to be educational and experiential so that you too can enjoy our culinary theatre. Welcome to the Pike Place Market market expansion. If you look right over there on my shoulder, you're going to see where our chocolate factory is being built right now.

 Speaker1: [00:00:07] Hi everybody. Welcome to Kajola Mo Farm, home of Honokohau Chocolate Company, located on the Hamakua coast of the Big Island of Hawaii. So we're going to take a quick tour of the farm, and we'll show you all the things that we grow and why this Kickstarter campaign is so important to us. One of the crops we grow here on the farm is turmeric, very widely regarded as a fantastic anti-inflammatory and also makes fantastic curries and things like that. One of our other crops that we grow here is white pineapple. It's very light colored, low, acidic, and you can eat the entire course, so not very much waste. Probably one of the best fruits on the planet. The main part of our business here on the farm is growing cacao and making chocolates from both Hawaii and around the world. Welcome to the farm store. This is where we make all the chocolate and we do our farm tours and chocolate tastings. This is where we make all our chocolate. We make about £20 a week in this little eight by ten room. And let me just point out a couple of our tools and things that we're hoping to upgrade. First, we've got these roasters here. These are both drum roasters. They do about two and a half pounds a piece. So you can you can kind of see where we we can only do about £5 per per batch.
 

 Speaker1: [00:01:33] We've also got we're doing our cracking by hand here and the other parts that we want to upgrade, we want to upgrade these machines. These are the loungers. It's basically a big stainless steel drum with a stone base and stone wheels very commonly used to make flowers. But it turns out it makes fantastic chocolate, too. We're typically doing about £5 in each one of these. They have a larger capacity than that. But in order to make a really good quality chocolate, you can't can't make that much. So and then the other things we have in here, we've got the tempering machines. Two of them. Both of these, these are batch tempering machines. These are all our current products. Starting here in the back we have cacao parchment tea made from the outside skin of the roasted beans up here on the your upper left. I guess it would be we have our 85 and 70% Hawaiian cacao made from beans, grown only here on the island of Hawaii. The Big Island, of course, as many know it. And then we've got these other choice chocolates. These are all chosen by me after many, many, many batches. It's the best of the best. We've got beans, chocolate made from beans from Fiji, Peru, Honduras, Ecuador, Madagascar and Vietnam.
 

 Speaker1: [00:02:57] And I have nicknames for all these too, because there's such a variety of flavors like the Fiji I call the fruit bomb, the Honduras Wumpa syrups, the peanut butter cup, and Ecuador. Camino Verde is the definition of chocolate, and the Vietnam Dak Nong is called the ResNet. The goal of our Kickstarter campaign is to upgrade some key machines here. Number one are starting with our roasters. We'd like to upgrade to about a £20 roaster. And then of course the Malandros. As I mentioned before, we're only we can only do £5 in those, so I'd like to upgrade to about a £20 Mellinger, possibly two other things that we'd like to purchase. Number one is a vibrating table. That basically makes sure all the air and bubbles and everything are out of the molds and that the molds are uniform. And we'd also like to install a three section sink in our new room so that we can stop doing the dishes down in the house. Well, that was a quick tour of our farm and our tasting room and chocolate making area, and I'd like to thank all of you for any pledges that you can make to help our business grow. Take care and I hope to see you all soon.",94.7,6,15,0.84,10,10

 Speaker1: [00:00:14] We decided to shoot this introduction out here on the Saint Louis River, which is a quarter of a mile where we live along a gravel road and Bachelor Square Road in Meadowlands, Minnesota, which is about 45 miles northwest of Duluth, Minnesota. We wanted to have this shot here because the river is so beautiful. We come down here to center ourselves, and it's so much like what reminds us of the Amazon River down in the places where our cocoa beans are grown and then shipped up here. The community has been so supportive of us, and we're excited about being able to make our chocolate in the in the small kitchen at Saint Mary's Catholic Church in Meadowlands. Yeah.
 

 Speaker2: [00:00:54] So it's a real it's a real comfort thing, both with location and atmosphere. But our favorite thing really, I mean, it has become making this great chocolate.
 

 Speaker1: [00:01:13] And we love it because it comes from the flavor of the land. We just take a bite and it's it's just this fantastic variety of flavors. So now we're looking to continue forward. Our business is growing more quickly than we can keep up in a sense. And we just need new equipment and we need to be able to keep up by getting bulk beans. And that's why we've decided to start the Kickstarter project and see how it goes.
 

 Speaker2: [00:01:40] Because we have to have bigger equipment. We use the same machine that we crack and shell with to shear the beans and start forcing the inherent oil out of the bean. So the difference is.
 

 [00:01:57] This screen goes in here, the friction heats up the bean.
 

 Speaker2: [00:02:03] Which starts forcing.
 

 [00:02:05] The oil out, and the blades cut it into ever smaller particles. Look at that.
 

 Speaker2: [00:02:12] That is the same as this.
 

 [00:02:18] There is no difference.
 

 Speaker2: [00:02:23] That. That just amazes me. Look at that. We want to be able to keep small batches. We do need to get bigger to meet the demand, but we still want small batches because in small batches you can really taste and listen to what each single origin of cacao bean has to offer in terms of flavor, profile, texture. And we love that. We're sort of like ushers of flavor gooey.
 

 [00:03:06] That's going to get smooth. And then we'll add sugar.
 

 Speaker2: [00:03:11] We buy our cane sugar bulk and they what we get comes in £25 paper bags. After I measure it out, I put it in the roaster and I heat the sugar up to 175 degrees. Because I want it to be hot when I add it to the cacao liqueur.
 

 Speaker1: [00:03:30] One of the exciting things about what we're doing is that we chose four countries of origin. So when you taste one from Nicaragua versus the Venezuela or the Bolivia or the Dominican Republic, you get a totally different feeling. It's the same thing. Cacao beans and cane sugar. But there's this unbelievable difference between one valley and the next, and that is the land. And we respect that. And we want to continue to, to just have people try each origin for its own sake. And part of our passion is for the land where it was grown. The farmers who are who are farming the cacao beans and the cocoa plantations down there because we know they're being fairly paid and it's ethically harvested. And we just love that idea. And then it comes up here where you've got a similar river and you've got the forest. It's not that different, it's just colder.
 

 Speaker2: [00:04:24] But we put in a lot of long hours because it's the.
 

 Speaker3: [00:04:31] Dual.
 

 Speaker2: [00:04:32] Origin cacao bean that dictates the process it needs to give what it has. We are exactly at the micron level one.
 

 Speaker1: [00:04:47] We use a horse syringe to temper our chocolate and mold it, because it gives us exactly one ounce at a time.
 

 Speaker2: [00:04:55] It's funny. I mean, you have to be mindful of what you're doing and be sensitive to all the different levels of flavors that the bean has to give. But you see those beans starting, and that's all it is. It's just that and sugar. And it takes 48 to 54 hours and you come out with this magic, which is.",87.83,7,9,1.36,10,10

 Speaker1: [00:00:14] Hi, I'm Gina Woods, creator of the all natural organic chocolate super bar. Feel the horsepower. What makes our bars different is the proprietary vitamin packed gel encased in a deep, dark chocolate. So let me tell you about our Feel the horse power bars. The biker bar. The biker bar is an energy bar filled with vitamins C and B12, ginseng root, ginkgo, guarana, spirulina, and other organic naturals. Since we use our gel as a delivery system for these ingredients, the absorption rate to the body is slower than other products on the market, like energy drinks. This results in a longer sustained energy with no crash. The fuel bar. The fuel bar is a meal replacement bar filled with grains, ginger, apricot, goji berries, kale, vitamin C and B12 and other organic naturals. This bar is recommended for people who want to supplement or even replace one of their meals per day. The sports bar. The sports bar is an electrolyte replacement bar filled with grains, vitamin C, honey, pineapple, ignatia, and other organic naturals. This bar is for anyone who has worked hard and played hard and needs to replenish lost electrolytes. Since we add no extra sugar, this is a healthier option over other sports drinks. The Nutrition and Energy Bar segment is projected to have sales at 1.3 billion alone this year. We need your help because we've got a great response and overwhelming response from people of all ages and walks of life. Currently, we have pre-orders from a major convenience retail chain and a dozen or so motorcycle dealerships. Our Kickstarter campaign is essential for our growth so that we can reach consumers nationwide. We need to get production going. We're in talks with a local manufacturer and distributor. However, we still need ingredients and suppliers working with this concept for only several months. We've moved quickly to the point we're at now, and we can't wait for you to taste the results.

 Speaker1: [00:00:00] I'm really excited to be on Kickstarter. I'm Kelly and I'm the owner of the Chocolate Lab. The Chocolate Lab is a small business out of Savannah, Georgia that makes artisan candy bars from organic, local, fair trade, and American made ingredients. I think the artisan candy bar business in America especially, is really just beginning, and I'm really excited to.
 

 [00:00:36] Be a part of that.
 

 Speaker1: [00:00:41] It's really important to me to support my community, which is why I use as many.
 

 [00:00:46] Local products as I can. I love You Got the chain.
 

 Speaker1: [00:00:56] With your support, I'll be able to buy the equipment that I need, which includes a commercial grade tempering machine, some confectionery frames, some bowls, spatulas, things like that, as well as my initial food purchase.
 

 [00:01:13] You got to change your evil ways, baby.
 

 Speaker1: [00:01:18] The way Kickstarter works is I set a goal and you guys help me meet that goal. And you can do that in one of two ways. You can donate anywhere from $1 up, and there's some really good rewards for you, for everyone that donates. And the other way that you can help is you can share this video with your friends and family, or on Twitter or Facebook or whatever you use most often.
 

 [00:01:42] I love your smile.
 

 Speaker1: [00:01:47] I have some really awesome rewards for you guys. Of course, chocolate is at the top of the list, but in addition to that, we've got chocolate lab stickers. Huge thank you for me forever. Like I will be forever grateful to you. And the coolest one, the one that I'm the most excited about is a custom made poster by my graphic designer, Kay Wolfersberger, and it's a chocolate theme and it's a limited edition run just for this Kickstarter campaign, so you won't be able to get it anywhere else. Thanks so much for supporting the chocolate Lab and spreading this video with all your family and friends. And on every social network you use. It's a huge help and I really appreciate it.

 Speaker1: [00:00:00] Hi everyone! I'm Brandon, founder and creative behind Eat Gold Organics, a collection of delicious adaptogen infused cacao bars. I'm here to ask for your support in helping me bring the magic of my bars to the world. Our mission is to deliver the benefits of plant medicines and nootropics to the mainstream through our premium, sustainably sourced, bean to bar chocolates with a flavor that's sophisticated and indulgent. Years ago, I became fascinated by the idea that the plants growing around me could be used for medicine. I started working with herbalists, chemists. I made a trip into the wild and experienced firsthand what indigenous people have known for millennia. Mother Earth heals. Why not heal with chocolate? The power of cacao is undeniable. It's a medicinal plant, a sacred plant, and a psychoactive plant, and it produces the same chemistry in the brain that occurs when we fall in love. This makes cacao an especially raw cacao, a true superfood. I started out playing around in my kitchen, making small batches for friends and family using all different ingredients. Taste testing. It's really been a labor of love. When my father was dying of cancer a few years ago with the okay from his doctor, I infused his diet with adaptogen, mushrooms, ashwagandha, turmeric, and others, and all these herbs had a visibly positive effect on his well-being. All of the chocolate bars cover most things that myself and my friends need on a daily basis. All the bars that I've created have a purpose. They taste amazing. We are 100% plant based and made only with organic, ethically sourced and traded ingredients. As a backer of this campaign, you will help me get these bars to anybody who wants to enjoy them. So thank you and happy indulging.",56.53,7,10,0.61,6,9

 Speaker1: [00:00:00] Welcome to the Kunchacko.
 

 [00:00:05] Who? Comes to vascular express. My name is Neelie, and I'm opening up a.
 

 Speaker1: [00:00:15] Bean to bar chocolate factory in Peterborough, New Hampshire called Vicuna Chocolate. The vicuna is the symbol of rarity and quality, and it's the national animal of Peru and the region where I'm sourcing my highest quality cocoa beans. Vicuna. Chocolate. Ethically sources the finest quality heirloom cocoa beans from Central and South America to produce the finest chocolate. I moved to Peru to learn firsthand from the farmers how to harvest cacao and process the beans into chocolate. I find the whole process fascinating, and part of my dream is wanting to share that with my community. So I grew up here in Peterborough, New Hampshire, and I'm really excited to be bringing back what I've learned from my travels home.
 

 [00:01:13] Do you think this is all new construction?
 

 Speaker1: [00:01:16] This was an old hair salon that in February I rented and gutted the place so much I can't even begin to explain how much work has gone in here since February. None. None. Stop. What I wanted to do was separate the factory from the front, but create a really big viewing window so people can come in and watch the chocolate being made, enjoy some hot chocolate, learn about the process, and then come and actually see it happening. I can't wait to open. This has just been a huge labor of love. My goal is to be open as soon as possible. As you can see, I'm almost there. And and you know, if you can help me out, I would really appreciate it.
 

 Speaker2: [00:02:05] Here's how. Vicuna Chocolate Factory and Cafe will use funds raised from Kickstarter. With your support, I'll be able to launch my online sales so that I can distribute my chocolate all over the country. Shipping chocolate can be expensive because of its sensitivity to heat and breakage. Packaging is a huge component when it comes to selling chocolate. I want my chocolate bars to look as good as they taste. I've been working with an incredible designer, and now the wrappers just need to hit the presses in order to make chocolate in the factory and serve drinks and pastries in the cafe, I'll need to hire a great barista. Outreach is very important at this stage of my business, and I'll use Kickstarter funds to help launch my wholesale business and a larger marketing campaign.
 

 Speaker1: [00:02:52] So Kickstarter is an all or nothing crowdfunding resource. So that means if I don't reach my goal, I don't get any funds. If you can donate in any way possible, or just spread the word to others who you think might be willing to donate, that would mean so much to me.

 Speaker1: [00:00:03] Hey, my name is Danny and I'm the creator of the Placebo Chocolate project. Our vision is to make it easy for people to share joy, love, and other aspirational experiences through chocolate. And the way that we do that is that we have these huge £1 chocolate bars which are made out of organic, fair trade ingredients. And then each week we put a different aspirational word on those chocolate bars. One week it'll be love, another week it'll be courage, adventure, joy, and so on and so forth. And then we make it easy for people to buy these chocolate bars and share them with their friends. And the other thing that's pretty cool about what we do is that each week, the featured chocolate bar, when it's purchased by one person, we actually will make another one, and we'll give it away to somebody who can be inspired by love, inspired by joy, but doesn't actually have the funds to pay for the chocolate bars. Anyway, I want to tell you a little bit about why I created this organization, and now there are a lot of stories of different co-creators and why they came to the organization. But at the very least, I can tell you my story. And my story is that about a year and a half ago, I felt like love, peace, joy.
 

 Speaker1: [00:01:17] The most elemental experiences were beyond me. They were outside of me, and I ended up having to take a very long journey to go find those things. I went to Spain and then Scotland, and then Guatemala and Argentina and Chile and eventually Peru. And the thing that got me out of that place where I was was people who taught me what love is. People who shared with me their love. People who shared with me their joy. And eventually I found that I already had that stuff inside anyway. It just took other people. It took a community around me to let it out. And when I understood that it was a community of people who had shared with me, that had given me the love and the joy and the peace and courage that I needed, I wanted to do something that made it easier for communities of people to share really wonderful, foundational, aspirational experiences with each other. So that's kind of the story anyway, behind Placebo Effect. And where we are now is is a really great place. We've done a ton of groundwork over the last five months to get this project kickstart ready. We created a website. Actually, it was award winning designers and developers who who built the placebo effect.
 

 Speaker1: [00:02:30] Dot com websites. We've got the custom chocolate molds and designs. We've basically got everything ready except for a couple of things, which the Kickstarter project is going to pay for. And the things that we need are we need to source the organic fair trade ingredients. We need to pay for the molds, which are very expensive. But we've got a really great mold manufacturer who are experts at doing this kind of thing, and we need to continue designing and developing the website. That's going to be our social arm, that's going to allow us to reach out to people all over the world so that they can share joy and love and so on and so forth with each other through chocolate. So you are actually our missing ingredient, and I hope to have the opportunity to learn from you, to talk with you, and to grow the placebo chocolate project with you in the future. I also hope that you can share this with your friends via Facebook or Twitter or anything else. Any other mechanism that that people share with with friends these days. And I want to say thank you. Thanks so much for taking the time to listen to me, and thank you so much for hopefully being a contributor to our wonderful project.",78.77,5,4,2.28,5,10

 Speaker1: [00:00:00] Hi Kickstarter, my name is Katie and I'd like to introduce you to my new business. Salts. Chocolate salts. Chocolate is chocolate which is made directly from raw cacao beans. It's what we call bean to bar chocolate. It focuses on using high quality beans that have been imported from sustainable plantations overseas, and then refined into amazing tasting artisan chocolate right here in the UK. Now, I'm an ecologist by trade, and I originally started making chocolate for myself and my friends because I was interested in food, origin and how our food is made, how our chocolate was made, and my friends told me that my chocolate was good enough to sell. So I decided to sell salt to chocolate, which is named after my family. So the process of turning raw cacao beans into edible chocolate is really quite labour intensive. It involves a number of different stages that require different pieces of machinery each stage. At the moment, I'm making chocolate in my kitchen at home using adapted kitchen implements and this makes amazing chocolate. But if I want to be able to sell the local farmers markets and delis, then I need to upgrade my equipment and buy a lot more ingredients in bulk. And to do this, I need your help. I need you to tell your friends and your family and your colleagues about my project, and ask them to take a look at my Kickstarter.com page. Hopefully, you'll be able to back my project so that I can bring salt chocolate to market. With your help, I'll be able to secure funding for commercial kitchen equipment, including a tempering machine, which will allow me to produce consistent quality chocolate at saleable quantities. A bulk import of cacao beans direct from sustainable plantations overseas, and the labeling and branding of my chocolate ready for sale. If you take a look at the reward page, you'll see a list of special rewards that you'll receive if you back my project, including lots of handmade salts chocolate goodies. So please help me make Salt's chocolate a reality and consider donating to my project. Thank you.",43.1,6,0,1.55,7,10

 Speaker1: [00:00:07] Hello everyone. My name is Joe Worley. I'm the owner and creator of Vineyard Chocolates. Vineyard chocolates is a luxurious gourmet chocolate bar product line which features wine flavored chocolate bars. I'm creating this Kickstarter campaign in hopes to raise $2,100, so I start making my bars more efficiently and getting more chocolate bars in the stores. Wine flavored chocolate bars is an idea that I had several years ago, but it wasn't until I moved to the small town of North Branch, Minnesota that my idea began to take shape. It was in this small town that I found a job at a food manufacturing facility, where I would find my soon to be mentors who would teach me how to make my wine flavored chocolate bar idea. And soon enough, I was making chocolates on my own. I spent a good amount of time to find the right chocolate for my recipe. I tried chocolates from all over the world, from Italy to Belgium, Madagascar, Ecuador, and everywhere in between. At one point I had over £40 of chocolate in my house, which I could use for my recipe. Testing the chocolate that I found to be the best chocolate in the whole world would be an organic chocolate that originates from Venezuela. The tropical climates of Venezuela gives the chocolate a deep, rich flavor that complements the wine flavor very well. It was with this organic chocolate from Venezuela that I created my first official flavor, a Cabernet flavored dark chocolate bar. I created a wrapper design, and I started selling my wine flavored chocolate bars to stores in my area, just to see how people liked it.
 

 Speaker1: [00:01:25] And guess what? People loved it. The stores would call me asking for more, and that's when I knew that I had something. I registered for a patent and I went on to create two more flavors Amarillo flavored dark chocolate bar and a Chardonnay white chocolate bar. I now have three solid products that chocolate and wine lovers absolutely love. Hi everyone! So as mentioned before, I work at a manufacturing plant where we make food products. I'm not going to say which food products we make here, but I would like to talk about what I am doing as far as, like my bars, my process and what I've been doing to make them so and this is going to explain the reason why I need to do this Kickstarter and I'm going to show you right now. So as mentioned, I've been making all my bars by hand and selling them locally in my area. And this Kickstarter campaign is going to help contribute to buying one piece of equipment that I need a lot more of, and that is going to be my mold. This is basically when I melt the chocolate, I put it into this mold and as you can see, this mold holds four bars. And I've been making all my bars by hand using just this one mold. So in one hour I can make four bars. I know it's not that's not the most efficient thing, but you know, this is what I started out with, just to even get my recipe going to see how well it works.
 

 Speaker1: [00:02:49] You know when I go to sell a dozen of these to a store, it takes me three hours to make 12, 12 bars. And so if I'm going to start selling more locally to events and things like that, I need to at least be able to make 100 an hour. So I need to at least get 25 more of these molds, and then I can start making them more efficiently. Also, in addition to the polycarbonate molds that I used for my bars, I'm also going to need to use the proceeds from this Kickstarter for insurance and get a display box. I need a display box design and everything, and I also need to get full designs made for my wrappers because this is my end result. I have a this is my chocolate bar, this is my wrapper, this is my design. And I made this and this design, this image. I made the design. Everything. But everything came from Google. I don't own the rights to this image, so I need to get professional image made and just a few other odds and ends just to get this thing going. As mentioned, I'm surrounded by all this great equipment that can handle large volumes of production, but I'm still making everything by hand, which is fine, and I enjoy it. But when I do have a bigger order. Say if I need 2000 bars made one day, I do have the option of using one of our chocolate machines that will temper the chocolate in.
 

 Speaker1: [00:04:15] This works at £50 £50 increments of chocolate, which would make 500 bars at least. So so not only that, I have this piece of equipment handy. I also have a great cooling tunnel right here. So basically it's a simple process of just melting the chocolate, sending down the cooling tunnel. Of course, with my magic and a little bit of flavor we'll have a great product. And here's also another thing is like I've also looked into getting other co packaging co packaging, other manufacturers to make this bar for me. They want $1.50 a bar, not even including ingredients. If I can make my bars here, it'll cost $0.50 a bar plus ingredients, which is $1 less than another. Co-packer. So if I make everything myself right here, I will be saving a dollar per bar and that would be great for business. Great for investors. Great for anyone who's in on this business with me. And that's why I need your help. For every pledge that you make to this campaign, it'll help purchase materials needed. So when I start making my wine flavored chocolate bars on a larger scale for everyone who makes a pledge to this campaign, you'll be rewarded with some wine flavored chocolate bars of your own. So please check out the reward options in the pledge options below this video. Make a pledge today and I will personally send you some wine flavored chocolate bars for your own, which you will have by the Christmas season, which is also a great stocking stuffer, by the way.",7.27,5,5,2.52,4,7

 Speaker1: [00:00:01] Hi, I'm Adrian in Bogota, Colombia, and the reason I'm doing this video is so that we can get funds for a cacao stone grinder. So the problem we have right now is that we're making chocolate using a food processor. You can see it in the sink there and the food processor, there's a couple of problems with it. And that is the we can't get the ingredients fine enough. And the second problem is, is the organic ingredients are being imported from Ecuador in the USA, which is crazy because we're here in Colombia and there is organic cacao beans. And with this stone grinder, we can just put the cacao beans in there and it makes the chocolate. So we don't need to worry about having butter and powder from abroad. And essentially we want Colombian chocolate. So the long term goals of of setting up Chuck through our chocolate business is to make and sell cacao powder and butter in Colombia, to make and sell chocolate bars in Colombia and abroad. And, you know, the real long term dream is to have an organic farm of our own and employ hundreds of Colombian people and care for their well-being and invest money and profit in their well-being, perhaps through yoga, meditation and other such things. So it would be amazing if you could support us with this in return for your pledge, you will get some amazing chocolate, and it's something I'm going to dedicate time to. I'm planning to spend a whole month just to making amazing chocolate. And in November and December, I'm off to Ecuador and Costa Rica to volunteer to learn about the longer term view. So of making the powder and having a farm and etc.. Okay. It would be amazing to have your support. Thanks. And by.",81.12,7,14,1.2,7,10

 Speaker1: [00:00:01] Hi, I'm Sandra Barber, and I don't know about you, but I love a good dark chocolate. Recently, I had to find soy free chocolate, and what I found out in the market was dry, chalky, excessively gritty. Not at all a pleasing experience to the palate of a chocolate lover. So I've spent the last two years creating a really good dark chocolate that takes me back to my sense of indulgence when eating dark chocolate. My goal was to create a rich, smooth and creamy chocolate from fair trade organic beans with no unhealthy fillers for those who had food allergies. My family and friends all say that I have succeeded in this endeavor, and that it ought to be made available to the public. That's why I created Kindred Chocolate. So why come to you through Kickstarter? Well, as you can see, the space over here, I need to convert that into a chocolate manufacturing facility. In order to do that, I've got to cover the walls and the floor with a washable material that meets food handling regulations. This wall behind me has to come out and the space behind it made into a dishwashing area. After that's all said and done, I've got to bring in the stainless steel tables and racks. As far as the equipment, what I have now is geared towards small scale production. Except for my tempering machine, it only has a pound and a half capacity, and I need to upgrade to a larger machine in order to bring my chocolate to you. I can do all of this for $14,000. Any money I raise over that will go towards upgrading other pieces of equipment to a larger scale production. If you look to your right, you can see the pledge levels and the awesome prizes that go with them. And I hope you're looking forward to experiencing Kindred Chocolate. I'd like to take a second to say thank you for all in any pledges. They are truly and sincerely appreciated. Thank you and have a great day.",32.52,7,1,1.07,7,10

 Speaker1: [00:00:01] One of the earliest moments that I remember as a child. I was 4 or 5 years old, and at the time we had already had five kids in the family, so getting quality time with my father alone was a big deal for me. We had a ritual in La Verne, California, where we would go and drive down into the Foothill Boulevard from Wheeler Avenue into an old Wienerschnitzel house drive through. But the cool thing about this was you'd come off the street and you would drive through the house to make your order and pick up your bag of chili dogs. There was a little patio with palm trees and umbrellas, but it was always that the smell, the moment with my father, the camaraderie, the laughter, and then the guy with the uniform on smiling as he's handing us two big bags. Let me leaning out With with with a, with service and you know like in a charisma in his eyes and enjoy your hot dogs. Enjoy your chili dogs. It's just it was a I knew it I instead of being a doctor, instead of being a lawyer, instead of being this, my daddy was in restaurants. I said, I'm going to be, I want to, I want to, I want to make people feel that way. But in 1995, Jamba Juice opened in Old Town Pasadena, where I was working as a Barneys Limited, a pub for my father, and sort of the quick casual segment grabbed my psyche.
 

 Speaker1: [00:01:35] I got to experience growth brands Jamba Juice, Chipotle, Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf Noodles and company watched how the infrastructure was built. The leadership was brought on, marketing was was, was given leeway. And how you go from 19 restaurants or 19 stores to 300, how do you go from 300 to 1200? How do you go from 1500 to 5000? And I was very fortunate to be around growth brands where that was happening. Bruddas is a culmination of embracing and dying on the sword for those brands, and working the same way I would if it was my own. If you were working and put yourself in in in a guest shoes, how would you want to be treated? And that is really, really catapulted ourselves into not only world famous food and outstanding desserts, but our service is second to none. And that VAT that brings me back to being a child of five years old again, and hopefully one day inspiring that another five, six, seven year old as they go through our drive thrus, or that moment with their mother, their moment with their father, that moment with their grandma, their auntie or their uncle, and getting really good food. That's hopefully what we get to do.",73.36,6,3,0.8,7,10

 Speaker1: [00:00:01] Hey, folks. Thanks. Thanks for stopping by the page. I want to introduce myself to you a little bit, and then some about my company and my project. First off, my name is Josh. I am a husband, and I'm a father of two amazing little boys, a three and a half year old and a two week old. So lots going on in our got lots going on around our house right now. I've been in the food industry for about ten years, and I worked everything from coffee shops to fine dining bakeries and candy shops. Everything in between. Several years ago, I had the opportunity to go to Le Cordon Bleu in Portland, Oregon. I learned a lot, had a great time. And I think that's really where the, the starting a chocolate company really began for me. You know I enjoy eating chocolate. Who doesn't? But I think that's where my eyes are open to what's out there. Really? And the chocolate world is such a big, big world. And so a lot of folks ask, why are you working in chocolate? And definitely why do you want to start your own company? Start your own bean to bar chocolate company. A lot of great companies out there. And that's true. There are. You know, today you can go to the grocery store and you can buy an organic chocolate bar.
 

 Speaker1: [00:01:23] That in itself isn't very unique, but that's the first pillar we're going to start with. We're going to be importing beans and sugar cane sugar, both organic from the Caribbean region, Belize, Dominican Republic as well as Guatemala and Central America, South America, Peru right now has some phenomenal products being produced. So organic is the first pillar. Second is compostable. The term compostable and biodegradable are tossed around very loosely now and kind of as the same word, but they're very, very different. Biodegradable doesn't really a definition to it. Anything is biodegradable. I mean, your cell phone a thousand years will biodegrade. I don't want that. Compostable. On the other hand, has a definition, has a scientific definition, and is that product has to be broken down into organic material in 100, 180 days or less. So the packaging that our chocolate organic chocolate bars will be in once it gets wet. So it's not going to happen to all the bars in it. That product, that packaging will break down in 180 days. It's not going to leave more of a mess in a landfill. It's not going to leave behind toxic chemicals in the in the earth. It just won't. Third is solar or alternative energy.
 

 Speaker1: [00:02:54] Right now I'm looking at solar companies. So we're going to produce chocolate that is made in a factory that is run by solar power. Chocolate bar that is put into a compostable packaging. And then that chocolate itself is organic. So like I said, I'm a father of two little boys, and I definitely want to leave a legacy for those for those little guys. Once I'm gone, you know, I want our company to be a benchmark in the industry For being environmentally friendly. By our by our cocoa from small farmers. Want to support those guys, you know, want to make a better life for them. So it's just important as a small business owner right now that we're taking care of the resources that we have in this earth. And so it's just very, very important to me. Those are values that you I think are important. I ask for your support. You know, right now starting this Kickstarter page is my goal is $2,900 with that money. I will buy the first set of small, small batch equipment. There are some equipment I can buy that I'll have to actually make. Starting out very small. There isn't a lot of equipment available for for small batch, so some of it is is homemade.
 

 Speaker1: [00:04:20] As you know, to with Kickstarter. If your goal is not met you don't receive any of the money. The money goes back to where it came from. So my goal 2900, $2,900 and we're two weeks into the campaign right now. This campaign actually launched the morning after my son was born. Second son was born. So he's a little late getting this video out. But I wanted to share with you some of my heart, some of where we're going with the company as a company, and the difference between us and the other chocolate makers out there. There are some great artists out there, but I want us to be different, and I want to produce a unique product for the consumer so they can enjoy good chocolate that they know is also good for the environment. So if you support us, I sent you donate some money. The as as somebody who donates, you'll be one of the first people to, to get to sample our chocolate. And I look forward to getting that chocolate made and shipped out to you guys. And definitely look forward to tasting it myself. So I ask that you support us. I ask that you help this project out, and I will be very, very grateful for your help. Thank you.",65.02,7,2,3.04,7,10

 Speaker1: [00:00:00] Michael Smith here, founder of Firebird Chocolate and Coffee. I'm excited to tell you about our Kickstarter campaign. We really need your help. We're looking to expand our presence and our growth in the Pacific Northwest with Certified Organic and Rainforest Alliance chocolate bars. Our first three flavors came out less than a year ago. Is there an Espresso Dark that came out last October, soon followed by a milk chocolate with 41% cocoa and a huckleberry dark at 60% chocolate. We've also added two direct trade single origin coffees, one from the Ergashev region of Ethiopia and another from Chocola, Guatemala. A small 52 family village in Guatemala. That is fantastic coffee. We need your help though. I'm asking you to consider pledging as little as a dollar as much as you want. In fact, we have ten $500 Firebird Founders Club slots that we'd love to fill as well. Please share this on your social media channels, Facebook, Twitter and any other channel that you have. And because everybody deserves great chocolate, please and thank you for supporting Firebird Chocolate. We hope to see you on that pledge board soon, so we can put more chocolate into your hands and throughout the world. Thank you.",99,6,11,1.29,6,9

 Speaker1: [00:00:12] Hello Kickstarter! We are Stefan and Bui, the makers of John Gilbert. It was our passion for sustainability and exotic foods that inspired us and producing an insect powered protein bar. John Gilbert is a great tasting product that is full of high quality proteins and minerals that will keep you going whilst taking a swing in the jungle or doing whatever you normally do. For the past year, we've done a lot of work with a great team of specialists to make Jungle Bar a reality. We've made countless prototypes and had lots of testing sessions with normal people like me to ensure an outstanding product. Today, Jungle Bar is ready for production and it's unlike any other protein bar on the market.
 

 Speaker2: [00:01:15] John Cooper is a delicious protein bar made with sesame, sunflower and pumpkin seeds, chocolate and sustainably sourced insect ingredients. Cricket flour.
 

 Speaker1: [00:01:25] Cricket flour.
 

 Speaker2: [00:01:27] Oh yes. The cricket flour we use comes from All-American farm raised crickets that have been dried and ground down to a fine flour. This cricket flour has a high protein content is full of iron, calcium, B12, vitamin Omega, threes and sixes, making it the perfect ingredient for our bars. We see John Cooper playing a big part in a food revolution towards a more conscious era of food, where edible insects are a big part of our diets.
 

 Speaker1: [00:02:00] Our mission is simple to normalise edible insects in the Western world and creating a product that people love, just like Apple does with computers. Only skip the apples and add the insects. Kickstarter.

 Speaker1: [00:00:02] Okay. We're on a mission to revolutionize the food industry by introducing edible insects. That's why we've spent the past half year perfecting the recipes of our insect bars. We call them dare squares. We use about 15% insects in our dare squares. But you won't get any wings stuck between your teeth as we make the insects into flour. First, insect flour is an amazingly nutritious product. It's rich in protein, omega three vitamins and minerals. We take the nutritious insect flour and mix it in with all the other natural and organic ingredients, dates, nuts, and seeds. The result is two types of delicious dare squares that are super healthy and also good for the environment.
 

 Speaker2: [00:00:49] A cricket requires 12 times less feed than a cow to produce the same amount of food, and 2000 times less water, and they hardly take up any space.
 

 Speaker3: [00:01:04] Wow. Yeah, I can vouch for it. Yeah, definitely. Yeah. Yeah, totally. It's good. I can taste the peanuts. A bit of salt. It's like. It's great. It tastes great. It's like a bar. It's like an energy bar. It's a good.
 

 Speaker4: [00:01:17] Combination. Sweet and sour.
 

 [00:01:20] Good. I like it.
 

 Speaker1: [00:01:24] So far, we've been producing our dear squares at home. It's been really fun to talk to people and see how they react. And we've been all sold out at every Christmas market. Now we're ready to move into a professional kitchen. That's pretty expensive, but it will make it possible to expand so that we can sell our products online and in shops.
 

 Speaker5: [00:01:45] We truly believe insects are the food of the future and we need to start now.
 

 Speaker1: [00:01:49] So dare yourself and a friend to join our climate friendly initiative so we can reach our Kickstarter goal and begin the first production.",92.89,10,5,1.39,5,10

 Speaker1: [00:00:00] Hi, I'm Jordan from Food First. Remember when you couldn't pronounce acai? Then there were goji berries and everyone started drinking kombucha. Well, get ready folks. I'm about to tell you about prebiotics and introduce you to a new superfruit. Let's start with prebiotics and why they're important. You really want to give your gut what it needs, and the probiotic bacteria in your gut need prebiotic fibers to survive. At Food First, we've developed a fermented multi prebiotic and protein mix made from organic wheat, oats, barley malt and flax. It's called probiotic, and it makes it easy for you to keep your microbiome strong. Now for that new superfruit. This deep purple berry from Canada is called the Saskatoon. Pretty cool name But what are they and what do they taste like? Saskatoons are high in antioxidants and provide an excellent source of vitamin C, manganese, magnesium, and iron. They're not new, of course. First Nations peoples across the Canadian Prairies have valued their health benefits for thousands of years, and they remain highly valued today. Saskatoons taste like blueberries, but a little earthier with a hint of apple.
 

 Speaker1: [00:01:19] Our saskatoons Saskatoon's Why Canadians are so good at hockey. We don't know if Saskatoon's will make you a good hockey player. That could be maple syrup. We've been blending probiotic with honey, fruits, nuts and other healthy ingredients to create delicious gut health bars for a few years now. Once we tried Saskatoons, we knew we had to make a bar that would give you an antioxidant bump to go with the prebiotic boost. Then we thought, if one super fruit is good, wouldn't three be better? So we've got saskatoons, aronia berries and blueberries. Throw in some tasty sunflower butter and this new bar, Sunny Saskatoon Berry is just about ready. Here's where you come in. With your help, we can import and process these awesome berries to create an even more beneficial microbiome bar flavor with three super fruits and four prebiotics. Our sunny Saskatoon Berry Microbiome Bars will keep your gut happy. They might even improve your hockey performance. This statement has not been evaluated by the Canadian Hockey League. From all of us at Food First thank you and stay microbiome strong.",96.54,6,8,1.23,,8

 Speaker1: [00:00:08] Hey guys. My name is Scott and I'm the founder and CEO of a new superfood snack bar made with cricket flour. The bar is called a veil bar, and you might be wondering why a veil? Well, the definition of a veil is to be of benefit or of use to consumers. And that perfectly lines up with our mission statement, which is to make the world a healthier place. So you might be wondering what makes these bars different? Well, aside from having cricket flour, they're functional in nature. So what does functional mean? Well, instead of eating a 300 calorie protein bar with 20g of sugar in the middle of the day, we've formulated each of our bars to serve specific needs. Our first bar, Work Out Hard, has the optimal macronutrient composition for pre or post workout. Our stomach repair bar is formulated with bananas, ginger, and cinnamon, all items known to relieve GI distress. And our regained focus bar is created with blueberries, goji berries, and green tea matcha to give your brain a quick boost. But that's very sustainable. Everything you eat either makes you healthier or less healthy. Shouldn't there be an option to eat something healthier while on the go? As the amount of processed food in our society increases, so does the incidence of disease.
 

 Speaker1: [00:01:19] And that is where the bar was born. All of Vail bars are made with premium quality ingredients their gluten, dairy, and soy free, non-GMO, and mostly organic. They truly are the superior quality snack bar. Some of you may be wondering why. Crickets. Well, the truth is, the current trends of animal agriculture are just unsustainable. In contrast, crickets are 60 to 70% protein by body weight. They're incredibly high in fiber, calcium, vitamin B12, and iron. They also have a much smaller footprint on the environment. They consume less water, less feed, and they produce less greenhouse gases than traditional animals. Since starting in February 2016, we've made so much progress. We've worked with nutritionists, food scientists, and recipe development specialists to perfect our first bar. Our workout hard bar. We have also done blind taste tests, partnered with a crooked supplier, and have a co-manufacturing facility ready to produce our first large order. All we need is you guys. We're asking for $10,000 to help us produce our first large production run. Some portion of the funds will also go to perfecting our next two recipes. We really hope you'll join us on this amazing, incredible journey to make the world a better and healthier place. And thank you so much for watching.",95.59,7,13,1.71,5,10

 Speaker1: [00:00:00] Hi, I'm James Oliver, Atlas bar founder and certified sports nutritionist. When I set out to create the world's best tasting, high performance protein bar, everyone told me it was going to be impossible.
 

 Speaker2: [00:00:11] You'll never be able to compete against those big brands and all their multi-million dollar ad campaigns. Plus, you're just too young.
 

 Speaker3: [00:00:24] Not to mention, you don't have any experience.
 

 Speaker1: [00:00:27] Instead of stopping me, their doubts only fueled my determination to succeed. I launched the company in 2017 using seed money that I earned from driving Uber. I even started selling Atlas bars door to door. And today, thanks to thousands of loyal customers and friendly neighbors. Atlas bars are the number one top selling, keto friendly protein bar. But don't take my word for it. Atlas Bar is the next generation protein bar. It has everything that you need and nothing that you don't. 15g of protein to build lean muscle, 11g of fiber for optimal gut health, and 11g of heart healthy fats. Naturally sweetened with monk fruit. There's only 2 to 3g of sugar and 4 to 5 net carbs, making it the perfect on the go breakfast, meal replacement, post-workout recovery snack, or guilt free dessert. Did I mention that every Atlas Bar is keto approved, gluten free, soy free, and of course, has no GMOs? Not only that, but Atlas Bar is one of the first and only protein bars to feature an innovative blend of adaptogen superfoods that help the body adapt to stress, fight fatigue, and boost endurance at the cellular level. These science-backed superfoods have been revered for centuries around the world as nature's gift to mankind for their immune boosting and hormone balancing properties that promote strength, vitality and vigor. I've been in the test kitchen working day and night on three new flavor recipes that will rock your world. Introducing Atlas Bar's new peanut butter and raspberry mint chocolate chip and almond chocolate chip. Your support will help bring these flavors to life by funding our first full production run. The test batch was very well received, and word on the street has me thinking that we hit a home run.
 

 Speaker4: [00:02:42] That's really good. It's very chocolatey. Yeah, it's vicious, so it's good that everything in here is recognizable and healthy.
 

 Speaker5: [00:02:48] Wow, man.
 

 Speaker6: [00:02:49] I've never had a protein bar that tastes like cookie dough.
 

 Speaker7: [00:02:54] Are these available yet? For real? These are so good. Oh my God.
 

 Speaker4: [00:02:59] Like, where can I buy these? Are these gonna be in Whole Foods or sprouts or what?
 

 Speaker7: [00:03:04] Atlas, I love it. I'm on board.
 

 Speaker1: [00:03:06] When I set out to create the world's best tasting, high performance protein bar, I embarked on a journey everyone said was going to be impossible. More importantly, what I've learned is that through hard work and dedication, the unconquerable human spirit is capable of achieving extraordinary things. I knew you could do it, honey.
 

 Speaker3: [00:03:27] Yeah, right. And I'm Jeff Bezos.
 

 Speaker2: [00:03:30] Alexa, shut up and order me another box of Atlas bars.
 

 Speaker1: [00:03:34] Starting at just $27, the Atlas Bar Kickstarter rewards structure offers tons of perks and, of course, early access to our new flavors. You can even build your own custom 30 count value pack, so go ahead and mix and match whatever flavors your heart desires.

 Speaker1: [00:00:01] Did you know an active person can burn 3000 calories a day and fuel up on 20,000 nutrition bars in their lifetime? Third, the weight of these nutrition bars is from additives such as refined sugars, fructose, and chemicals, all harsh on your digestive system and even worse, for your health. Oh yeah. That's why we engineered the bar in the jar with all raw and uncooked ingredients to best retain nutritional value, vitamins and minerals as a semi-solid. We put it in a jar so you can fuel on the go as much as you need. Reseal and put back in your pocket without the fear that it will melt or get wet. If you're doing water sports, it also comes in a Ziploc wrapper as a solid we call the brick, which provides a different pocket experience, and a gel pack is on the way.

 Speaker1: [00:00:59] Hi, I'm Marco, creator of bar in the jar. You may know not all calories are made equal. That's why the bar in the jar is calorie optimized from all natural ingredients and is protein rich to promote better metabolic health. To deliver sustainable energy with the highest natural calorie per gram ratio than any other product out there. And to eliminate the spike and crash feelings you usually get with other products. The bar in the jar is potassium rich for better cardio health, and is moderately naturally sweetened with raw honey and sun dried on sulfured. Apricots. Best of all, it is kid approved.

 Speaker1: [00:00:00] I'm here to share with you my ultimate health food snack hack for the family granola bars. They're convenient, and when I make them from home, I know exactly what goes into them. And I can spend time with my kids while doing something for them. For me, the hard part came after I baked the granola bar mix, and I had to cut them up into bar shapes. The baked granola bar mix was either super hard to cut through, or they would fall apart when I cut them up. This is why I made the granola bar pan to make the process much easier. When I decided to make my own pan, I knew it had to do three things. First, it had to make granola bars into actual bar shapes that didn't fall apart. Second, it had to make it so that the bars were easily popped out and removable from the pan. And third, it had to be even easier to clean. It's dishwasher safe, or you can wash it by hand. In addition to these features, I've added Phil guidelines on the inside of each cavity so you can see that you filled each of them equally. As a result, your bars bake evenly and they are all the same size. Also, it's made out of food grade silicone so it cools much faster than a metal pan would. Here's what also sets the granola bar pan Japan, apart from other silicone pans. Other pan number one are. Other pan number two. Other pan number three. Wah!
 

 Speaker2: [00:01:23] Wah! Wah!
 

 Speaker1: [00:01:24] I designed the pan to be more rigid and sturdy. And now here's the granola bar pan. Ooh. I don't do floppy silicone, and neither should you. I've already invested in the tooling and molding for the granola bar pan, and this is proof that it exists and works. But I want you to use it, too, so you can also enjoy making your own granola bars for your friends and family or yourself. I need your support here, not in my kitchen, but here on Kickstarter in order to build a foundation for a successful business so people everywhere can buy granola bar pans. I truly believe that everyone will benefit from the granola bar pan. And not just parents and bakers. Whoever you are, however you live. The granola bar pan will help you make amazing granola bars for you, your friends, and your family. This is the granola bar pan. We're the most honest. Granola bars you'll eat are the ones you make yourself. I'm Katrina, and thank you for backing this. Hey, guys, where'd you put the oats? Let's make another batch.",64.33,6,9,0.62,6,8

We came to you back in 2014 and are back, launching a whole new flavour and a whole new look. We began this journey three years ago when we were freshmen in college, considering late to our 8 a.m. financial accounting class and with the idea of eating your coffee.

You helped us go from producing ten bars an hour to over half a million bars with our manufacturing facility, and since then we've been serious about getting people to eat their coffee.

 Speaker1: [00:00:04] Hey. Guys, welcome to Austin, Texas. Austin is a lively city full of healthy people with an active lifestyle. Here you'll find cyclists, runners, kayakers, mountain bikers, rock climbers, the casual walker, and the health enthusiast, all of which are seeking to have fun and stay in shape at the same time. Austin is a friendly city for anybody with an active lifestyle to live. You'll find miles of hiking and biking trails right in town, in addition to outdoor rock climbing, natural springs for swimming, and a lake right in the middle of town. And Austin isn't lacking when it comes to sports shops, either. With a plethora of running stores and a bike shop on nearly every corner. You will never have trouble finding an outlet to fulfill your equipment needs. In addition to quality sporting outlets, Austin is full of healthy eateries and locally owned coffee shops. You can't drive more than a few blocks without passing a great coffee shop, smoothie joint or other healthy eatery. All this to say, Austin is the perfect place to launch Adventure Naturals 100% all natural organic raw food snack company specializing in raw energy bars and seasoned nuts. Our bars are better than any other on the market because 100% of the ingredients are organic. Additionally, our bars and nuts are air dried, not baked. The result? A more nutritious food bar and nut full of healthy enzymes and nutrients.
 

 Speaker2: [00:01:26] Hi, I'm Caleb Simpson, founder of Adventure Naturals and its always been my dream to own my own business, but I've never found any that I was truly passionate about. In the past, I had experimented with a couple of different ideas, one of them being like freelance graphic design, freelance web design and also freelance photography business. But I never really, truly enjoyed what I was doing in those. But what I know for sure I'm passionate about is things like outdoor activities such as rock climbing, cycling, running just pretty much anything outdoors. And I also discovered in the past year that I have a big passion for eating healthy and raw foods. Just anything that's 100% all natural, organic, essentially to fuel your adventure, so to speak. I've just really realized just providing your body with this all natural foods is it's the best source of energy possible. And also, just with doing all these adventurous things I'm doing, I'm finding it's difficult to eat on the road. You go into a gas station, you're just going to find nothing but junk food. And there's so many fast food restaurants. It's hard to eat healthy. And so what we want to do with Adventure Naturals is bring you a healthy option. Something that's easy and quick to grab on the go and you could carry with you in your backpack or in your car. And this is quick and easy to grab.
 

 Speaker2: [00:02:38] And another thing that gave me the idea of it was about a year ago, I posted on one of my energy bear recipes on my blog, The Organic Climber, and several people complimented me on the recipe, saying how great it was even on Twitter. A couple people told me they would be willing to pay me to produce the bars, so at that point the seed was planted. But it wasn't until about a year later until I decided to team up with Chris, who you're about to hear from, and just go in and take off with the idea. Just knowing there's people out there really do want to eat healthy, and that's why we think this is going to be successful, because we know that you want to eat healthy. We know that you're looking for healthy options out there, and that's what we want to provide. In addition to just like the background I have in marketing and Chris's expertise in the health industry, we know that this is going to be a successful project, but we're going to need your help. So check out the project, read the details in the bio and check out the different gifts, the different giving levels that we're going to provide. We've got some great things we're going to give. So check it out and we'll hope you support us. Thanks.
 

 Speaker1: [00:03:40] Hey everyone. Chris Herbert here with Adventure Naturals co-founder and I just wanted to give you guys a little brief description of who I am. I'm actually been in the industry for roughly about coming up on 11 years, and I've worked in a health food store, I've managed a health food store, co-owned a health food store, and now I actually work for a for an herb company going around the US educating people about alternative health, healthy lifestyles, healthy eating. And so I've been in the business a long, long time. And so that's why I really wanted to start Adventure Naturals in order to bring good quality ingredients, good quality food to the people. Healthy snacks. Healthy alternatives for snacks to the masses. So it's just all about healthy eating. And that's really what we're boiling it down to. So I noticed there was a there was kind of a a niche in the market that had to be served. And that's what we're here to do. We're here to to give people quick snacks, especially people that are on the go, active people. So it's a quick, simple, healthy snacks to fuel your adventure. That's what Adventure Natural is. That's what we really believe in. That's a little bit about who I am. Also, I love to do a lot of outdoor things. I love to even just be out outside in nature like we are now. Play disc golf, regular golf, basketball, baseball, any type of sports. And then with my other co-founder, Caleb Simpson, also some rock climbing. He'll teach me a little bit about that too. Kayaking. I'm really a big fan of also, so anything outdoors, that's what I like to be a part of. So thank you guys for watching our video. Thanks for your support as well on Kickstarter. So we really appreciate it. Thanks again.
 

 Speaker2: [00:05:25] Now here's we need your help. The start up costs to make this all happen come close to $10,000. And we're asking you to help us with half of that. Your donation will go to pay for things like kitchen equipment, food dehydrators, our first month's rent, and our first batch of product. Every gift level receives at least a food bar from our first batch of product, so help our dream of providing healthy, organic snack foods to active people in the Austin community and beyond become a reality. And remember, we actually need more than we are trying to raise here on Kickstarter. So please keep on giving. Even after we've met our goal here on Kickstarter.

 Speaker1: [00:00:00] Do you care about what you eat?
 

 [00:00:06] Some will say.
 

 Speaker1: [00:00:11] We do because it's hard to get the right nutrition. Billions of human beings need protein to exist. But a typical protein sources are flooded with problems chemicals, antibiotics, overprocessed foods, missing amino acids, water pollution, greenhouse gas emissions. Too much waste. Deforestation. Inhumane animal living conditions. We searched for a source of protein with the same quality as meat, an equally sustainable as plants. We found a cricket protein. Dried and milled crickets are superior, sustainable and a moral source of complete protein. In production, they need less feed, less water, less space, and can be fed with plant based food production byproducts that would normally be wasted. Crickets are also an excellent source of vitamin B12, iron, and calcium. So we took this amazing protein, mixed it with natural ingredients, and create a nutritious protein bars and delicious energy bars. We have teamed up with a renowned chef with 13 years of experience in cooking with insects. We used only natural and the best quality ingredients. No compromise, no chemicals. Solely delicious, nutritious and from sustainable resources. Our protein bar is the world's only all natural bar with 20g of complete protein inside. And our energy bar is the most nutritious, guilt free, and delicious snack. It gives you the much needed protein or is a quick, healthy snack.
 

 Speaker2: [00:02:09] Hi! We successfully created our protein and energy bars. But to make them economically viable, we will need to meet minimum production quantities. We also plan to introduce more products.
 

 Speaker3: [00:02:21] But in order to do so, we need your help to bring the project further. Let's change our diet to a superior and far more sustainable one. Pre-order our bars or pledge for rewards and help to bring sense foods to life.",91.14,10,9,0.86,,10

 Speaker2: [00:00:19] Why doesn't my brain work?
 

 Speaker1: [00:00:23] So you grab an energy bar, which works great until it doesn't. Hi, I'm Will, and I too was an office sloth with snack regret. Which is why I created IQ bar, the first nutrition bar optimized for sustained mental energy and performance. Most bars are packed with carbs and sugar, causing blood sugar spikes that may help you scale a mountain, but will sabotage your check in with Bernard. Armed with a background in psychology and neuroscience from Harvard and a love of snacks.
 

 Speaker3: [00:01:07] I set off on a year long journey to flip the conventional, high carb, low healthy, fat bar on its head.
 

 Speaker1: [00:01:15] The result is the perfect brain food. Not only do IQ bars have just 8 to 9 net carbs, saving you from the blood sugar roller coaster, most bars will take you on, but each bar is optimized around five critical nutrients scientifically shown to support long lasting, crash free energy, improved cognitive performance, and a healthier brain. And the best part? These nutrients come from ingredients in eight year old could find in a grocery store. Ingredients so clean even your yoga teacher Moonbeam approves. With a bar this healthy, you may assume it tastes like a boot dipped in kale juice. Gross. I'm biased, but let's hear from a stranger, sir.
 

 Speaker4: [00:02:04] Tastes like heaven.
 

 Speaker1: [00:02:06] So here's the deal. We've conducted a small sample run of our first three flavors, and we're ready to produce more. But we need your help to produce our first full production run. So please back us for a few boxes and help us make food for thought a reality.",78.32,10,0,1.92,,10

 Speaker1: [00:00:00] Hi, I'm Mike Rosenberg, owner and founder of Gurukul Bars. Gurukul bars are handmade energy bars that we make right here in Burlington, Vermont, using local Vermont raw honey as our main ingredient. What makes our bars so special is that we make them fresh by hand every week, using no preservatives and only wholesome, all natural food that you can see and pronounce like dried cranberries, whole peanuts, brown rice crisps, and whole grain flakes. We're also the only company to use 100% consumer recyclable packaging, and we donate 1% of all of our profits to gorilla conservation, which is where we get our name from. Gurukul is one of the few remaining mountain gorillas in the world today. People love lots of things about Gurukul bars, but the thing they love the most is the human touch that we put into everything we do with our business. We send a handwritten note out with every order we get into long email conversations with them about what they're doing and where they're going in their life, and they send us photos of them when they're out on adventures around the world. And the result is we've grown a wonderful community of supporters around the bars that are just as invested in everything as we are. We have a very open relationship with them. They send us a lot of positive feedback and sometimes some constructive criticisms. And the general consensus is that if you've had a karaoke bar, you know two things. One, they're incredibly delicious, and two, they can be hard to open. So much so that we've heard stories of people who have to entirely unwrap them and put them in their bike jerseys before going on a ride, or climbing gyms where they have to leave a pair of scissors next to the box of karaoke bars.
 

 Speaker1: [00:01:26] Using recyclable packaging is very important to us, but as a small business, there are not a lot of eco friendly options out there. Our current process is that we take the bars by hand and put them into sleeves of the material, and then place them on a basic sealer that can produce an inconsistent seal. And our only option to fix this is either use a material that's not eco friendly, or invest in a new packaging machine. The benefit of the new machine that we want to buy is that it produces a seal that will help keep the bars fresher, longer, and make them much easier to open. Going forward, this will be an important tool for continuing our growth and allowing us to focus on making high quality energy bars by hand, not packaging them by hand. Kuruku bars has always been a community oriented business, so it seemed only right that we include the community in this next phase of our growth. We're hoping to use Kickstarter to allow everybody a chance to be a part of what's happening, and we have some wonderful opportunities for donors, including some of your favorite endangered editions from the past. The cost of the machine that we need is $25,000. We're asking for $8,000 as a down payment. Please take some time today to support our project. We'd love to have you as part of our community.",99,7,5,1.72,9,9

 [00:00:10] There was a lack of bars on the.
 

 Speaker1: [00:00:13] Market that fit our needs that we that we had for what we were doing at the time. We were running ultra marathons, and we get these bars and we take them out on our training runs with us and they tasted like shit. Did you just say they taste like shit? So VQA is a Latin derivation meaning the act of conquering. Our product is gluten free, soy free, dairy free, vegan, non-GMO. You can flip our bar over. You can pronounce every single ingredient on that. You know, things like dates, almonds, cashews, pea protein, organic dark chocolate. And we just needed a product that tasted great, tasted like a candy bar, has great texture. They taste fucking awesome. I started out with ultra runners like us then. Now it's turned into yogis crossfitters stay at home moms, stay at home dads like business people, coffee shops, health food stores. We also partner with a lot of local gyms, and our overall goal is just to bring a bar to literally every household in America, to be fucking awesome and to also create a fucking awesome bar. And this is where you come in. We're very passionate about our company and our community, and we want to continue to grow. So this is where you guys come in. We have a manufacturer in place with manufacturing capabilities of a million bars a day. And this is where you come in. We're ready to go into national retail, but most major retailers require multiple product options. We've already completed our research and development on our two new flavors, Coconutty and Cafe Mocha, in preparation for our national rollout. We teamed up with a marketing company that helped us rebrand our company look website, video production, and new packaging concepts. The feedback we've been receiving on our new look is extremely positive. Now all we need is capital to mass produce our new bars and fund our national advertising campaign. We've worked so hard for the last several years, and we are so close to realizing our dream of bringing VCA to every household in America. And this is where you come in.

 Speaker4: [00:00:40] Athletes and donut fans across the country have flocked to us ever since our company's humble beginnings just over a year ago.
 

 Speaker5: [00:00:47] We are thrilled at the popularity of our product and we love our customers, athletes and fans. They inspire us every single day. While our protein donuts have helped us grow exponentially as a company, we aren't ready to slow down yet.
 

 Speaker4: [00:01:03] Ever since I was a kid, I've loved treats, and one of my all time favorites is the Rice Krispie Treat.
 

 Speaker5: [00:01:09] If we could create protein packed donuts, why the heck would we stop there? We are super excited to introduce the next protein treat from our company. It's filling, really tasty and comes in one package. Introducing the crispy bar. With our crispy bar, we want to continue pursuing our mission of creating innovative, delicious, protein rich treats that everyone can enjoy.
 

 Speaker4: [00:01:41] We want our Crispy Bar to be available not only online, but conveniently in stores, across the country and eventually across the world.
 

 Speaker5: [00:01:50] We are working tirelessly to create a product that everyone can enjoy. We are going to ensure that the ingredients of our crispy bar are a high quality and ethically sourced.

 Speaker4: [00:02:31] We're in the middle of formulation, headed in the right direction, aiming to pack at least 15g of protein in our crispy bar. Now we need your help to launch this project and get our crispy bar in your hands in a matter of months.
 

 Speaker5: [00:02:45] That's right. Our plan is to produce this product and get it into the hands of our protein loving friends by October or November of this year.

 Speaker1: [00:00:02] Superpop is a all natural, gluten free protein nut butter bar with none of the top allergies, so no gluten, soy, or dairy. I'm Melissa Weslie, I'm a mom. I have a seven year old daughter, and I have a new baby on the way before I have my daughter. My husband and I would eat protein bars, right? Because you're on the go. We didn't really, at that time look at a lot of the ingredients, which is high fructose corn syrup, artificial flavors. Once I started looking at labels, I realized there wasn't really anything out there that had high fat, good protein that came from actual nuts and grains like quinoa. And so I decided to create something crispy. Quinoa is more like a popped version, kind of like a cereal. It's a complete protein and it's actually really delicious.
 

 Speaker2: [00:00:48] My six year old daughter is a very picky eater, and when I first gave her the bars, I actually was not optimistic. And she loved them. She loves them and she eats them regularly. She asks for them. Him. So I mean, it's kind of amazing to find something that I am happy to give her that she also wants to eat.
 

 Speaker3: [00:01:05] I've got a lot going on, so whatever I can do to get myself through the day or just give myself that boost, I need it.
 

 Speaker1: [00:01:15] I keep on making super pop because I see how happy it actually makes people. I'll run into somebody and they said, I just had your bar and it was so good. Like, that really makes me want to work harder and actually get it out to everybody. As we expand and grow, we're not going to be changing the ingredients of the bar. We're going to stick with our values of always including healthy, all natural, organic ingredients. The first thing we need to do is we found a manufacturing facility. They're going to work with us to ramp up our production. Thanks to our fans. We're getting lots of orders now. And the good thing about this manufacturer is they have the same values as us. We're a small batch, so we do smaller runs. So the bar that you receive was probably made just a couple weeks prior. We're so proud that our bars don't have preservatives. And like many of the other bars, and when you don't have preservatives, you usually have a shorter shelf life. So when it comes to preserving a bar, it all really comes down to packaging. So we are working with a designer to come up with packaging that will be high barrier. Many retailers want us to have this packaging because they need a longer shelf life. We would like to add more people to our staff to help with outreach, and getting more people aware of Superpop, and getting us into more stores. With your help, we can continue this snack revolution that we started helping people with celiac digestive disorders and people that just want a healthy, yummy, good snack on the go.",84.49,7,11,1.79,10,10

 Speaker1: [00:00:00] Listen up. Our suspects, peanut and the Tree Nut Gang. The deadliest food group in the world. We have one mission. Catch these killers and keep these bad guys out of our food.
 

 [00:00:23] I. Can't stand it. We can't plan it. Not showing up. Sneaky as bandits, I can't eat nothing when they're in there. And other ingredients ain't so crystal clear. So why you eat trash and wonder why we're avoiding EpiPens in our thigh? Oh, my God, it's no allergy. I'm telling y'all, it's Blake's nut free. So listen up, cause you can't eat nothing compared to us. Those other bars are disgusting.
 

 Speaker2: [00:00:59] One mission nuts are gone, and this is what keeps us going on and on. Cause others say you might not get. And we can bet. So don't you get duped yet. It's a dream. No hyperbole. I'm trying to tell y'all it's Blake's nut free.
 

 Speaker1: [00:01:16] So growing up with a nut allergy is tough. When I was three years old, I was basically diagnosed, and it's something I've dealt with my whole life. I have to carry an EpiPen. I've been hospitalized numerous times and I couldn't trust any food brand. When he looked at the market, every snack either had nuts in. It was produced in a facility with nuts, or it just wasn't healthy. So during an MBA entrepreneurship class at Indiana University, I started tinkering with recipes in my kitchen, coming up with something that was healthy and something that people with allergies and without allergies could enjoy, and that led to the foundation of the company. So we knew to get this product to market, we couldn't keep making it in my kitchen, unfortunately. So we scoured the country and we landed a deal with the premier nut free manufacturer in the world.
 

 Speaker3: [00:02:01] So even though I don't have a nut allergy, I love the bars we've created at Blakes Nut Free. They keep me satisfied on the go throughout my day. The best thing about our 170 calorie bars is that they have ten grams of protein and zero added sugar. The bars we've created at Blakes Nut Free are made using absolutely no nuts. Our nutritious based recipe uses real ingredients including dates, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, egg whites and chicory root fiber. We're launching initially with three flavor combinations that we think you're going to love lemon berry, dark chocolate banana, and apple ginger.
 

 Speaker1: [00:02:35] So we arrested the nuts and we made a great product.

 Speaker1: [00:00:00] Hi, I'm Zora, and I make the Wild Zora beef and veggie bars. We got started because I wanted a healthy snack for the family. We all like to snack. The kids and my husband and we would eat the healthy bars that are on the market. But when you look at the back of the package, they have a lot of sugar. And, you know, we would eat them and 45 minutes later we would feel hungry again. So that wasn't a good option for us. Then I would look into jerky, and jerky has a lot of salt. It's very tough to eat and it has MSG often and it has nitrites and nitrates. So again, I didn't feel like it's a healthy option for us. And so I got inspired actually from a paleo cookbook. And I got this idea of taking meat and veggies, which I consider a complete meal, and put it together and make a healthy high protein bar. We make our bars in our own USDA certified commercial kitchen in Loveland, Colorado, where a federal inspector comes every day to make sure we make them safely. We use 100% grass fed beef in our bars and veggies, kale and sweet bell peppers. And we have three flavors. The most popular has been the sweet and spicy. We never add any sugar to our bars. The sweetness comes from dried apricots and there is some cayenne pepper at the end. The second flavor is the parmesan cheese and basil. Kids call it the pizza flavor, and we use hormone free cheese in this one. And the third flavor is our barbecue flavor. It has some ancho chili peppers and chipotle peppers. It's not spicy, but it gives it the nice barbecue flavor.",84.32,7,10,0.62,10,10

 Speaker1: [00:00:05] The first time I ever met Rob's parents was at the emergency room in Beth Israel Hospital. Rob is deathly allergic to peanuts and tree nuts. We were out to dinner and there was some cross-contamination. It was really scary. It was the first time that I had ever really been exposed to an anaphylactic reaction. When we got home, I hit the internet and tried to find out as much as I could about food allergies and how many people suffered from them, and the numbers were staggering. Millions of people had an allergy similar to Rob's, and there weren't really a lot of options on the shelves for me to feed him. That's where kind of 88 acres was born. 88 acres is a healthy snack company free of the top eight food allergens. We're going to market with three flavors of bars. The first is our triple berry. It's blueberry, cranberry, and Zante currant. The second is apple and ginger, and the third is a dark chocolate and sea salt. I grew up on an 88 acre organic farm in North Brookfield, Massachusetts. When we were thinking of starting a food company, we really wanted to get back to the roots of sourcing the best possible ingredients that we could and just capturing that feeling of home baked goodness. One of the amazing things about food is that it brings people together. When you sit down at a table and you share a meal together, it's where this sense of love and community comes from. You know, I realized that my passion for food could now be turned into something that could solve an issue that we were facing every day. I started out in the kitchen tinkering with different ingredients until we thought we got it right.
 

 Speaker1: [00:01:49] We started sharing with friends, and those friends started sharing with their friends, and the feedback that we were getting was overwhelmingly positive from both people who suffered from food allergies and people who were just looking for a great tasting, healthy option. Over the past ten months or so, we've been able to sample thousands of bars to people in our community, but we really want to be able to bring the company to the next level to reach a wider audience. And that's where we need the help of the Kickstarter community. We need to purchase ingredients for our first production run, and we need to do some facility and plant trials. We also need to get our packaging finalized and printed, and with the help of the Kickstarter funds, we'll be able to accomplish these three huge milestones, which will allow us to get our products on the shelves to as many people as possible. You know, I consider myself to be really lucky. I got to start a company that was founded out of the love that I have for somebody else, and keeping him safe and knowing that our products are making other people's lives better and easier and safer is really what we're all about and what we thrive on. We took an overly processed product like a granola bar and just brought it back to basics with simple ingredients, healthy ingredients, and we just focused on the taste and it tastes amazing. It's a bar that anyone can eat and anyone can enjoy, and that's the beauty of 88 acres of bars.",92.79,10,12,0.67,8,9

 Speaker1: [00:00:02] Here you go. One latte, extra shot, 200g of waste. Thanks. We all know coffee produces a hell of a lot of waste. But did you know this waste actually starts at origin? Let me explain. Follow me. Coffee is actually a fruit. This is the coffee cherry. And it is jam packed full of antioxidants and plant micronutrients. But it is also thrown away. It is the forgotten super fruit that never made it to your pantry. Such is the waste tissue in coffee that to make up that latte she ordered, 91% of the coffee fruit was wasted. Globally, that's billions of kilograms of waste per year. Approximately 20,000,000,000kg.
 

 Speaker2: [00:00:44] Coffee farming is in crisis. A crisis of unsustainable overconsumption without the proper management of the natural byproduct of coffee fruit. We are alarmed at this problem and wanted to create a solution. Hi, I'm Vanessa.

 Speaker2: [00:01:04] Is the coffee fruit bar. Coffee Fruit Bar is Australia's first environmentally conscious health bar made with upcycled coffee fruit. Each bar is natural, plant based, gluten free and helps to offset 70g of coffee fruit from becoming waste.
 

 Speaker1: [00:01:21] Snacks are supposed to be convenient, right? So we made a bar to suit your daily needs. I mean, if you're going to drink coffee, then why not eat it too?
 

 Speaker2: [00:01:28] But does it taste like coffee?
 

 Speaker4: [00:01:30] And what about the caffeine?
 

 Speaker1: [00:01:32] Coffee is a super fruit, naturally low in caffeine and high in antioxidants. Plus, it tastes like a delicious blueberry. But if you're into that caffeine kick like me, our espresso flavour is the one for you.
 

 Speaker5: [00:01:46] Plus, each bar gives farmers an opportunity to develop a new product in their market, and it gives us an opportunity to present that product in our market.
 

 Speaker2: [00:01:55] Over the past year, we've been flat out testing our product with customers and in cafes. Since March 2019, 19. Our customers have helped us upcycle almost one ton of coffee fruit from becoming waste.
 

 Speaker1: [00:02:12] That's right. But to really take our waste upcycling to the next level, we need your help to produce our first production run of bars. We aim to move from craft to home compostable packaging, scalar operations, and provide that much needed farmer support at origin.

Paleo prebiotic contains no added sugar, no gluten or peanuts. It's high in antioxidants and has been developed for optimal bioavailability. Human food has been formulated to support people on vegetarian or vegan diets, but is good for anybody. Each bar contains essential vitamins and nutrients that can be difficult to obtain from a plant based diet, including 100% of the recommended daily intake of vitamin B12 and 50% of the recommended intake of iron, vitamin D, calcium, zinc, and omega three. Each bar also contains over 12g of protein. If you're already following a complete plant based diet, human food should make life simpler. If you eat meat and want to reduce or stop. Human food makes that change easy. There's three types red, green, and yellow. All three also contain whole daily amounts of functional ingredients. Ginseng, maca, and cacao. These ingredients have proven curative and preventative health benefits when taken regularly in the right amounts. The yellow bar also contains 500mg of high strength turmeric curcumin. The red bar has extra antioxidants from cranberries and goji berries, and the green bar contains four grams of spirulina. No other food product in the world contains whole daily amounts of these ingredients. Human food is a health food shop in a red, green, or yellow wrapper. Human food is filling enough to replace any meal.
 

 Speaker1: [00:01:53] It can be eaten as a bar, drunk in a smoothie, or broken up into muesli or porridge. The tastes somewhere between sweet and savory. It tastes delicious, but not of anything specific. The organic nuts, seeds and fruit have been finely balanced to make the taste so smooth it's almost neutral. That's how it still tastes good five days a week, even after a year. And to make your own flavors, you just add fruit to smoothies. Human food makes it easy to maintain an optimum diet that is complete, organic, plant based, and includes whole daily amounts of functional ingredients. With one bar of human food, you know you're good for the day. Five and you're covered for a week, 20in your backpack, and for a whole month. It will be easy to maintain the best possible diet.

 Speaker1: [00:00:04] Hi, I'm Austin, and this is Shawn, and we're the co-founders of Fit Living Protein Bars. At Fit Living, we're revolutionizing the protein bar and changing the way people think about one of the most widely consumed snacks in the world.
 

 Speaker2: [00:00:18] Food that is edible after sitting out for months is rarely very tasty or nutritious. There is no argument that fresh food tastes better and is better for you.
 

 Speaker1: [00:00:26] We thought that protein bars should abide by the same standards, so we created fit living bars.
 

 Speaker2: [00:00:31] We make gourmet protein bars handcrafted fresh upon order. Our bars are made with all natural, wholesome ingredients that are all gluten free in nature.
 

 Speaker1: [00:00:40] Taste and nutrition are at the forefront of our cause, and the truly fresh factor is the difference. You can see, taste and feel.
 

 Speaker2: [00:00:46] After working on the recipe for almost a year during our last semester of college, we pulled together a few hundred dollars we had each saved and worked day and night to bring this vision to life.
 

 Speaker1: [00:00:56] Once we had our first physical product, we began sampling to everyone we could find and the response was amazing.
 

 Speaker2: [00:01:02] Yeah, having the first truly fresh protein bar got people interested and the balanced nutrition also helped. But what's really propelled us is the taste of our bars. Having a bar made upon order, with all fresh ingredients and no preservatives, separates the taste of our bars from all others.
 

 Speaker1: [00:01:17] We've had people who are dedicated to other protein bar brands and people who hate it. Every protein bar they'd ever tried. Suddenly buying dozens of fit living protein bars for themselves every single week.
 

 Speaker2: [00:01:26] We've also been selling out at all of our markets, and a lot of local shops have began carrying fit living bars, including two La Fitness's.
 

 Speaker1: [00:01:34] We've made a lot of progress that we're proud of, but we need your support to help us expand and ensure everyone has a chance to buy the best protein bars.
 

 Speaker2: [00:01:42] Right now, we are working between our commercial kitchen apartments and both of our parents homes. With only two of us and the nonstop reorganizing and commuting, we are running out of time to do what's most important make great protein bars for great people.
 

 Speaker1: [00:01:56] We need this extra boost of money to cover the expenses of getting into our own facility. In our own facility. We can build an infrastructure to grow and concentrate our time on new goals.
 

 Speaker2: [00:02:06] The money we raise will be allocated to licensing fees for our facility, kitchen equipment and initial renting costs. Also, it will allow us to upgrade our packaging and give us an opportunity to hopefully employ people as we grow.
 

 Speaker1: [00:02:18] Please take a look at the rewards for contributing. We hope you find one that interests you.
 

 Speaker2: [00:02:22] If you can't contribute, that's okay. All we ask is that you help us spread the word. We really appreciate all the support from our current customers and future ones.
 

 Speaker1: [00:02:30] With your support, we can make this possible.

 Speaker1: [00:00:02] It's definitely my favorite one. My name is Tyler Hallam and I am the founder of Modern Jerky. Modern jerky is a premium plant based jerky snack. It's made with all natural ingredients. It's soy free, so it's very high in protein, low in carbohydrates because no added sugars to it. And it's an artisan product. So each piece and each package is being individually done by myself. The idea for Modern Jerky came around the beginning of quarantine when, like everyone else, I was stuck at home, found myself snacking a lot, and I tried to keep it healthy, tried to stay consistent, you know, eating fruits and hummus and granola and things like that. But ultimately, I found there's very limited options for a high protein, plant based snack. So I've always liked to create and try and come up with new food products and ideas. And I eventually landed on the idea of a plant based jerky, because I noticed there wasn't really any options for that in the market. And so I spent the last 6 or 7 months or so just developing, refining, just testing, batch after batch after batch. And now in the last month or so, I've been able to put it together a website, start building a little bit of brand awareness and really get the project to a point where I think if I put it up on Kickstarter, I'd be able to take the project to the next level. For Kickstarter, I'm bringing not just an idea, but an actual product, So I have this is a prototype of the packaging right now, just to be able to show the concept, to show that I've done the nutritional information for it.
 

 Speaker1: [00:01:26] We have the logo, I have the website, I have a lot of the pieces already in motion. And so the funding that I'm looking for would be able to really help successfully launch the product. And the details for what the funds would be used for is listed below the video. But at a high level, it's to be able to get the design and artwork for proper packaging to make sure it's shelf stable to print the packaging and then be able to move into the production process. This is the first time I've ever done any sort of crowdfunding or Kickstarter campaign, but I do fully believe, and I'm confident in the fact that if we're able to fund the project, I'd be able to successfully launch this by the end of the year. So on the right hand side, there's a couple of different pledge options variety pack sizes. And there's even one for to work together to do a custom flavor. So I think that would be a unique idea for anyone interested in that. And ultimately any sort of support and contribution would be greatly appreciated. Anyone has any questions about the product or the timeline or the ingredients, feel free to leave some comments or send an email. I'm very excited about launching this. I hope you are too and thank you for watching the video and thanks for any support.",11.07,7,8,0.72,7,9

 Speaker1: [00:00:00] What do you think? Oh my God, was not expecting this at all. It's so good. It's not fishy at all. It's really good.
 

 Speaker2: [00:00:21] One for Neptune makes healthy, sustainable fish jerky.
 

 Speaker3: [00:00:26] What? Fish jerky.
 

 Speaker2: [00:00:29] Why fish jerky? Because I love the ocean. And I am passionate about sustainable food. Each year, half of our seafood supply £450 million goes to waste. We've created a product that has been tried by over 3000 people, and I can't believe how positive the reviews are.
 

 [00:00:52] It's delicious. They're not painting. Oh my gosh.
 

 Speaker3: [00:01:01] That's fish. That's no way. That's really good.
 

 Speaker2: [00:01:05] People would ask, oh, this is delicious beef. This must be like grass fed. And you turn around to that person and say, no, you're actually eating sustainable US West Coast rockfish.
 

 [00:01:15] If you hadn't told me that was fresh, I never would have known. I never would have known for real? Yeah.
 

 Speaker3: [00:01:21] Okay. Fish jerky. Rocks. That is delicious.
 

 Speaker2: [00:01:25] Now people are starting to say, hands down, your fish jerky is more delicious than beef jerky. And then when you add to that, the fact that it has one and a half times the protein, it has 3100 times the omega three seconds, there's almost no saturated fat. And we can tell you the story of the sustainable fishermen that are catching the product. So often I get a text message that will say, hey fish friend, what is this fish? Is it sustainable? Is it from a safe place? Help me. And to me, that's a very clear sign. People want healthy seafood in their diet. They're not sure how to buy it. They're not sure where to buy it. There needs to be easier, more convenient ways to eat seafood. You know what? Easier way than as jerky. That is really, really delicious. Wild caught. Traceable directly to the small scale fisherman that caught caught the product and also has a minimal impact on the environment. It's best choice by Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch that's green listed. This was a way in my career. Can I really make a difference? Make an impact to address these problems in the seafood industry that we want to see change. It just so happens that the solution is is really delicious, but we know that most of the work is still ahead. We have we have a lot of work to do. I mean, these are not even real packets. In the last week, visits to our website have increased ten x. A movement has started and we're sort of along for the ride. And we are so excited to launch this product. But we need help. We're about to start producing our fish jerky. You know, we need to raise the money to actually get it out into the world. Join us today, support our Kickstarter, and help us launch our product into the world to help create a healthy, sustainable, and delicious future for you, for me, and for the sea.",69.86,10,9,1.06,7,9

 Speaker1: [00:00:10] I really wanted to make a beef jerky. And so we tried it and I was we were kind of blown away. We were like, this has to go on the menu right now. We can't be the only ones eating this. This is amazing.

 Speaker2: [00:00:30] I am born and raised in San Diego. I'm from a small town rural, on the outskirts of San Diego called Lakeside. I knew from the time I was 16 that I wanted to own a bar.
 

 Speaker1: [00:00:48] It started back when I was probably 17, bussing tables. For years, I had always tried to figure out how to get out of the restaurant industry. I did all these things, trying to figure out how to get out of the restaurant industry and finally realize that I was good at it.
 

 [00:01:07] Again, going back.
 

 Speaker1: [00:01:08] To the quality of the meat that we use. It's when we opened ten years ago. It was exceptionally important to the three of us that we are bringing in not only the best quality meat, but that it was to our standards. It's what we hold our team to. It's what we hold ourselves to. And so we thought it was very important that it's what we hold our ranchers to. The standards of what we look for in using a vendor or a product are exceptional quality. It's one of the reasons that we actually visit the ranches that we source from. It's important to us to see how the animals are being treated, how they're being raised, how they're being fed. Not just the relationships with the farmers, not just the relationship with the ranchers, but it's the actual quality. It's the quality that you get from a product that is treated humanely. It tastes better.
 

 [00:01:59] I'm Victor Jimenez, I'm the.
 

 Speaker3: [00:02:01] Executive chef and partner of Cowboy Star Restaurant. So the quality of our jerky and I think what makes the difference from other brands. It starts with the main product, which is the beef from snake River farms. It practices a lot of humanely managed, hormone free natural products. So after your first bite, it was like, boom, there it is.
 

 Speaker2: [00:02:23] The reason we're so excited to share the beef jerky with the rest of the world is it is great flavor, clean label, delicious and different. Beef jerky.
 

 [00:02:33] You've never had beef jerky like this. Always wanted to do the best product possible.

 [00:00:02] How all you foodies and jerky lovers.
 

 Speaker1: [00:00:05] For those of you that don't know me, I'm Andy. Uncle Andy's jerky. Back in 2012, I wasn't satisfied with the jerky on the market, so I decided to start a company focused on flavor innovation. Over the years, we have created some great flavors, but I haven't been able to explore as much as I'd like to. After searching long and hard, I found a partner that would allow us to make our own jerky. What this means is we will be shifting our model to focus on flavor development by launching a pilot series and a beer series. The pilot series, we will be exploring cuisines and flavors from around the world, using them in our jerky felt. The beer series isn't a beer flavored jerky. Instead, we are reducing the beer and cooking with it, letting the beer inspire the flavors we create, alternating between the two. We will be bringing new flavors every month, with each flavor only being available for two months. Also, with the focus on you, the consumer, we aim to create flavors that you want to do. So we are going to start crowdsourcing flavor ideas through our social media.
 

 Speaker1: [00:01:09] While we are very close to launching both of these series, we still need a little help getting early production runs rolling. Since this is all about the jerky, that's where our rewards are focused on. You have the opportunity to get in early on three, six, or even 12 months of delicious new jerky flavors. We've been working on some amazing flavors. We prove how good they are. We will be sending samples right away to the first 100 people to contribute $60 or more to try and share with their friends. Five years ago, when I randomly decided to make jerky, I never imagined all the amazing places I get to go, the great friends I make along the way, or the fact that I'd be living in my van behind a meat shop. While it sounds crazy to most people, I love it. Every single day I get to experiment and explore with new flavors to share with you. Thank you for your support so far, and I can't wait to share new flavors with you soon!",84.51,7,1,1.68,7,10

 [00:00:18] Introducing kelp jerky.
 

 Speaker2: [00:00:25] Akua starts with a C. Today, there are over 10,000 different types of seaweeds, many of which are full of vitamins, minerals, and omegas, and may contain more vitamin C than orange juice, more calcium than milk, and more protein than soybeans. Our kelp jerky is made from ocean farmed kelp, which is a zero input crop, meaning it requires no fresh water, fertilizer, feed, or dry land to grow. Ocean farming also helps fight climate change. Seaweeds filter five times more carbon out of the water than land based plants do. Out of the air, while also invigorating our shoreline ecosystems for hundreds of species, you can say kelp farming is pretty much the coolest.
 

 Speaker3: [00:01:02] We know now that seaweed is probably the most sustainable form of large scale agriculture in the world. So we set out on a mission about two years ago to figure out how do we make it more valuable? How do we make it into a marketplace, and how do we figure out ways of incentivizing more farmers to grow it?
 

 Speaker4: [00:01:20] Oh hey there. It may surprise you, but when those glasses come off, I'm a pretty wild and crazy guy. That means eating foods that keep me energized and feeling good when I'm not clicking through Excel or telling people to spend wisely. I'm turning labels because I care about what I put into my body. What I love about kelp jerky is that it's high in protein, high in fiber, and plant based. In addition, it's free of refined sugars, soy, gluten, and sticky binding agents. For me, it's the perfect snack. And most importantly, it's delicious.
 

 Speaker1: [00:01:51] Whether you've just swum across an ocean or you're getting hangry on a road trip, Kelp Jerky is going to be your new favorite snack by helping to fund our Kickstarter. You're helping us launch a coup and our first product, Kelp Jerky. This year, when we hit our goal, we can move out of our little East Village lab and fund our first scaled production run. We can also purchase recyclable packaging, which costs twice as much as regular packaging, as well as launch our online shop so we can sell Kelp Jerky to you internationally from day one. In exchange for your support, we'll be shipping you bags of our brand new kelp jerky, along with Cool Akua and artist created swag, all made from eco friendly materials. If we were making food out of commodities like corn, soy, and meat, we wouldn't be raising money on Kickstarter today. But instead we're creating delicious food that's as healthy for you as it is for the planet. So join us as we explore the boundless potential of the ocean sea greens that lie just beyond every shoreline in the world. It's a wild adventure that could change the way we eat for generations to come. So thank you for being a part of it.",91.3,10,7,1,6,10

 Speaker1: [00:00:09] Throughout my day, I travel quite often and look for a high protein snack like beef jerky. I'll stop at a convenience store and pick up a bag of jerky and disappointed with its flavor because it has high preservatives, high in salt, and just totally tasteless. So about a year and a half ago, I started making my own beef jerky, trying different ingredients, coming up with different marinades, using no preservatives, no MSG, and less than sodium. To this day, I've come up with some great marinades with bold, unique flavoring.
 

 Speaker2: [00:00:41] Jake and I have known each other for over 30 years, and I believe with my background in accounting, small business, and food service, I can make this business grow.
 

 Speaker1: [00:00:52] And my 20 years of experience in the media will help with marketing and promotional campaigns. The texture of our jerky is easy, but not tough, like biting into a piece of shoe leather. All our jerky is made with high quality black Angus beef. Korean sashimi has a nice tangy and sweet with sesame overtones. Chili. You'll think you're eating a bowl of chili. You may want some cornbread with that classic twist your classic jerky taste with pepper, but not too hot. With a twist of sweet, smoky, fruity flavor, Mesquite barbecue is a complex, light, smoky barbecue flavor you think came right off the backyard grill. There you go.

 Speaker1: [00:01:40] We hired a company for expert market research that shows jerky growth. Sales in 2012 were up almost 13% and continued growth in 2013.
 

 Speaker2: [00:01:50] Because beef jerky is a healthy snack, market research projects increase in jerky sales for the next several years. Captain Jake's jerky logo and website are ready to go. We have our business plan completed. We also have a signed contract with a family owned USDA A inspected facility with over 30 years experience in making jerky.

 Speaker2: [00:02:31] This is where you come in Kickstarter community.
 

 Speaker1: [00:02:34] With your contribution, we can take this to the next step and offer Captain Jake's Jerky to the American public.

When describing biltong, the best way is to imagine if prosciutto and jerky had a baby. That baby would be built on.
 

 Speaker2: [00:00:39] So biltong is cut with the grain and it's dried by air instead of heat, so it stays tender and delicious. We also don't use any preservatives or corn syrups, so unlike jerky with that sweet taste, biltong stays very natural. It's almost like tiny pieces of steak in a bag.
 

 Speaker1: [00:00:56] Biltong is perfect for the paleo lifestyle any high protein diet. Kids love it. Hikers. Basically anything with a mouth. And because it's similar to prosciutto, you can use it in dishes like pizza.
 

 Speaker2: [00:01:08] Salads.
 

 Speaker1: [00:01:09] Sandwiches.
 

 Speaker2: [00:01:10] You can even bake it into bread in muffins. So the company was built with two goals in mind one to bring biltong to America and two to make a difference in our neighborhood while doing so. Eat and feed is our way of giving back to the community. We give away 10% of our net profits in the form of actual biltong to local Brooklyn organizations.
 

 Speaker1: [00:01:30] We donate biltong because it's a sustainable, lean, healthy snack with a long shelf life. With your support, we can purchase our drying box. This is the last piece of equipment we need to get started and provide you with bolt on. We need your help to outfit our facility and make biltong a household name.",89.34,6,4,0,5,10

 Speaker1: [00:00:12] Organic beef jerky that's as healthy as it is affordable is extremely difficult to find, and we both love beef jerky, but we also care about what goes into our food. The problem is, is that the majority of beef jerkies are full of preservatives and nasty chemicals, but sweet meat is jerky. Reinvented. My name is George Livingston and I'm in Raffalovich and we are sweet meat jerky. About eight months ago, we started experimenting with different recipes, and what we wanted to accomplish was to create an organic product that didn't contain any of the artificial ingredients our competitors include like MSG, nitrates, and everything else artificial. After finding the perfect recipe, we knew that we could do better, so we didn't want to stop there. We wanted to package our product in a completely biodegradable and recyclable package so that when the product was gone, so was the package and the cycle can continue. In February, we started selling at the Nashville Farmers Market, but between school and our business, we weren't able to keep up. So we developed a relationship with an organic manufacturing company that can help our business grow. So we have the product and we have the packaging, but we need your help to bring the two together. The funds we raised from Kickstarter will allow us to place our first order and begin selling our product around Nashville. There's more information about Ian and I and our business on the page.

 Speaker1: [00:00:02] I'm Jason Kurbjuweit. These are my colleagues Brandon Batiste, Kevin Hicks, Brent Labounty, and CEO Michael Carvalho. And we are the co-founders of True Gentleman's Jerky. You know, the idea for True Gentleman's Jerky actually probably follows us all the way back to our days at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, where before we were gentlemen. Yeah. So? So, Jason, Kevin and I lived together, and we were actually lucky enough to taste a recipe that was passed down from generation to generation. And Jason's family of beef jerky. My dad taught me to make jerky. So his dad taught him to make a really good jerky. It was all natural. It was really delicious. And it really saved us from some. These are live props right now. Yeah. So his dad taught him to make a very, like, all natural, delicious beef jerky product that that we're all really lucky enough to have. But it wasn't really until we kind of graduated and Jason was studying for his CFA, and and I was studying for my MBA, and it really became crucial, actually, that we had an all, you know, all natural, really nutritious snack to kind of go to our corner store had chips and, and this rubbery product that they called beef jerky, but it really wasn't what we were looking for. We didn't want to be doing that to our body with this junk food. So we resorted back to the beef jerky that Jason had made in college and kind of started making it more frequently. He started giving it to some colleagues and friends, and at that point it started to really snowball, and we started maybe realizing we didn't have enough resources to supply it to everyone that you guys need to be chewing that loud. We currently have a goal of $10,000 for our Kickstarter campaign. I want to pass it over to our CPA, Kevin Hicks, to explain some of the goals in the future of our company.
 

 Speaker2: [00:01:33] Currently in the growth stage right now, we're experiencing a lot of startup expenses. We really need to improve our cash flow. We need more jerky.
 

 Speaker1: [00:01:42] I'm now going to throw it over to our CEO, Jason Kirby, who's going to share some of the future goals of our company with these Kickstarter proceeds. First, we'll be able to get into a larger kitchen and ultimately produce more jerky. We're also looking to obtain a more sustainable packaging, and we have other product lines and flavors that we'd love to bring to the market. Lastly, we want to continue doing what we've always done, which is obtaining locally sourced, all natural, healthy ingredients. These ingredients are the secret behind our low calorie, protein rich, handcrafted jerky, and we want to continue to maintain the personal relationships that we've formed with our vendors, because in the end, that's what a true gentleman does. Also, we could use more jerky.",98.58,6,14,1.32,6,10

 Speaker1: [00:00:01] I grew up eating jerky, I love jerky. Jerky is probably the one food that everybody loves. The reason I stopped eating it is because it wasn't healthy. So my thought was, why can't we change the game? Let's make a good one, you know, let's make a better version. The idea of think jerky is to think before you eat. It's to think about what you're putting in your body. All of our proteins are hormone and antibiotic free, grass fed beef and free range turkey. They're all sustainably farmed from local farmers across the country. Think about who's making these recipes to develop our recipes, I partnered with the country's best chefs.
 

 Speaker2: [00:00:41] I was so excited to have a chance to work on beef jerky or turkey jerky, and make it be what I've been looking for.
 

 Speaker3: [00:00:51] As far as him saying he wanted to keep it like chemical free is natural as possible. Just it was a breath of fresh air.
 

 Speaker4: [00:00:58] The interest I have for jerky is to go back to some of the roots, which is a very natural product, trying to create something that will be healthier, that will be a very good source of energy and make you feel good.
 

 Speaker2: [00:01:10] He wanted chef driven flavors created by chefs.
 

 Speaker3: [00:01:14] Geared towards not just men, geared towards men and women.
 

 Speaker1: [00:01:16] We're creating a consumer packaged good, but we're doing it with the precision and thoughtfulness and technique of some of the finest restaurants in the world. We're launching with flavors Sriracha Honey, which is the perfect combination of sweet and heat, and we use real honey ginger orange bright, clean flavor with some Asian undertones. Sweet Chipotle, which is made with real raspberries and smoky chipotle for. Thanksgiving we use real cranberries and a spice mix that will remind you of Thanksgiving.
 

 Speaker4: [00:01:51] When I came into the US in 97, I never experienced Thanksgiving, so it's really something that we we love celebrating.
 

 Speaker1: [00:02:00] So this is why we're on Kickstarter. It's because we're using the highest quality ingredients. And to be honest, it's very expensive. So the only way that we can make the quality product with integrity that we want and deliver it at an affordable price, is to order in very large quantities. We have the farms, we have the USDA facility, we have our ingredients source. We just need your help to make this project a reality. Now think healthy. Think delicious. Think jerky.",90.34,8,20,0.63,10,9

 Speaker1: [00:00:01] Hi, I'm Dan Ford, and welcome to bald Rock. This is my story of bald rock beef jerky. This is Ginger and this is my dog Blizzard. And they are both Australian kelpies. And this is my horse, Monte Cassino. I've always been interested in making my own beef jerky. I've tried all the beef jerky brands on the market, and I don't like buying those leathery, processed, full of preservatives brands. The beef jerky that I can't even eat a packet of. And the thing is, beef jerky does not need to be this way. This is how I first started making my beef jerky with a small food dryer. Then my friends took a liking to my beef jerky. And now everyone likes my beef jerky. And when my trays got taller than me, I decided it was time to do something bigger. And the result is my all natural product. This is real beef jerky. I make the best beef jerky. You can help me by sharing this with your friends and supporting my Kickstarter project.

 Speaker3: [00:00:17] Thank you. Thanks, guys.
 

 Speaker4: [00:00:21] Hey. Excuse me. What were the guys talking about over there?
 

 Speaker3: [00:00:25] Come on, I'll show you. Hi, I'm Dave. Thanks for checking out my project. Now let's take a look at my meat and nuts. I'm making all natural, awesome flavors of beef jerky and roasted nuts. I got tired of having mediocre products, so I decided I would do it better myself. Root beer, habanero, moist beef jerky, cinnamon, Jamaican dry beef jerky and a ghost pepper. Beef jerky with some serious heat or all ready to go. We have butter, toffee, almonds, citrus, chili, almonds, honey, cinnamon, almonds, orange honey and raspberry honey. Almonds are all ready to go as well. I only use the highest quality local all natural ingredients and then I treat them with all my love. Real smoke, real honey. Grass fed beef, delicious California almonds, no preservatives, no nitrates, nitrites, gluten free, and lots of other cool buzzwordy stuff. The quality is as good as it gets and there's something for everyone. The funds we raise on Kickstarter will be used to do larger runs of beef. This will not only help get the costs down, but it'll create a better product, a much more consistent flavor. Any extra funds will be used to develop the packaging and the labeling. I've been developing and testing the product and the process for over a year, with thousands of dollars and hours spent leading up to this point. I need your help to take it the rest of the way. I'm launching through Kickstarter because I'm a backer. I believe in the community and the power it has. All rewards will be delivered in time for the holidays, so get your loved ones what they've always wanted. Dave's meat and nuts. Please help me achieve my simple goal of putting my meats and nuts in as many mouths as possible. Thanks for watching. I appreciate your time, your support, and please reach out to me if I can answer any questions. So go back the project.

 Speaker1: [00:00:01] Hey, Kickstarter, my name is Jesse and I'm here to talk to you about Sriracha beef jerky. But first I want to introduce you to a friend of mine. This is Lynette.
 

 Speaker2: [00:00:11] Hi Kickstarters. My name is Lynette, and I own LG's barbecue.
 

 Speaker1: [00:00:15] She's a loving mother to four beautiful children and also the owner of a small barbecue restaurant in northeast Tennessee. Between wrangling her kids and serving some of the best fresh smoked barbecue you've ever tasted, she also finds time for one of her favorite things of all fresh beef jerky. The restaurant business is a tricky one, and lately she's been relying more and more on sales of her beef jerky to make ends meet. Word has begun to spread, and now everybody in the area knows where to go to get the best beef jerky around. Now, let me tell you what makes this jerky so amazing. Unlike other products, this one has a secret ingredient genuine Sriracha sauce. You know the stuff? The big bottle full of red gold with the rooster on it. She goes through entire cases of it every week just to keep up with demand. There's simply something about that sauce that makes this jerky one of the most uniquely delicious things you could possibly imagine. She's just about reached her maximum capacity in terms of what she can do with her current equipment. So we're turning to you. Kickstarters to help her make it to the next level. In return for your generosity. You'll get some of the most incredibly delicious jerky you've ever tasted. Every batch is hand-trimmed to perfection, marinated and then given a generous stripe of sriracha for good measure. For those who don't like spicy, we also have a traditional teriyaki. There's also a kick and garlic version and a recipe from one of our favorite TV chefs. We'll just call that one the a B flavor. So go ahead, click on the back of this project button and get ready for your new favorite jerky. So tell me about the beef jerky.
 

 Speaker2: [00:02:10] The beef jerky. The garlic is my favorite, but the Sriracha is really unbeatable.
 

 Speaker3: [00:02:23] I'm nervous.
 

 Speaker2: [00:02:25] I'm nervous. That's what I do when I'm nervous.

 Speaker1: [00:00:02] Hi. I'm Andy. Of uncle Andy's jerky. People tell me all the time they don't like jerky. I typically ask them, do you eat meat? If so, there's no reason you shouldn't love jerky. It really comes down to flavors. I was at a steakhouse one night and had this amazing mushroom blue cheese steak. Wondered why can't we take this out with us? Backpacking on a road trip? So that's exactly what we did. Introducing Boise's mushroom blue cheese beef jerky. As a startup, we faced many challenges developing new flavors with package design and recipe development. We're asking for your help to get this first production run rolling of this amazing new flavor. In return, you'll be one of the first people to try this jerky, as well as have an exclusive right to her mushroom, blue cheese, everything seasoning to be used on steaks, burgers, fish, potato salad just about anything. But this perk is only available for those who pledge to earn our fundraising campaign. You've spoken and we've listened. This is just the start of us bringing you seasonal and limited run offerings. With your help, we can begin the journey and bringing you the flavors that you love.",97.27,7,12,0.44,6,10

 Speaker1: [00:00:04] Hi, I'm Jim Nielsen. This is my partner, Monica Wallace, and we are Jimmy Sticky Jerky, based in Los Angeles, California. We have been or I have been making jerky for about 15 years. And Monica here talked me into doing it for business. So now we're flat broke.
 

 Speaker2: [00:00:24] Right now we're working out of our home office, which isn't bad.
 

 Speaker1: [00:00:32] We need a new office. What flavors do we have, you ask? We have plenty. We have beef. Sweet. We have turkey heat. We also have turkey, sweet and beef. Heat. Cilantro and lime. Very good. It's a new flavor. Our new barbecue flavor is pretty amazing. Black pepper. If you like. Black pepper, chock full of black pepper. We have fire. It's got the ghost pepper. We have the sage. They're really freaking hot. Notice the cow's eyes are red. That's from eating R of H. This is a step where we actually make the jerky. We actually cook it. We could really use some new equipment. It seems a little outdated. That didn't work. So. We started this business with very little money just basically what we had in our pockets. But we're coming up against now is the ability to increase our production to the point where we can actually start doing this for a living versus just something we want to do.
 

 Speaker3: [00:01:51] We have we have the product. We know it's good. It's doing fantastic in all the ratings. We're getting all of the orders, and now we're at the point where we're going to max out on our production for what we can do to handle our current volume. And we want to do that next step.
 

 Speaker1: [00:02:05] Right. The next step is making thousands more bags than what we're doing now, like.
 

 Speaker3: [00:02:10] Keeping the same.
 

 Speaker1: [00:02:10] Or keeping the same quality.

 Speaker1: [00:00:07] Hey, Kickstarter. I'm Brad, owner of Savage Jerky Company. First, I want to thank everyone that supported our first Kickstarter campaign. We had such amazing success and had a chance to meet some incredible people, many of whom have become friends and customers. There have been many exciting things happen over the past several months. We had a baby. We're producing jerky that people love, but most importantly, we've rekindled our love of Sriracha. That's why I'm here today. We've had some incredible feedback from fans over the past several months, and even people that love the hottest stuff we make ask us for a few milder flavors. We feel that Sriracha is the answer. With your help, we'd like to introduce three new flavors to our current lineup. All three of these highlight the subtle sweetness of Sriracha, but also stand on their own. Sweet. Sriracha. Barbecue. Sriracha. Teriyaki and Sriracha bacon jerky will provide those that want the heat, the distinct chili flavor that Sriracha offers, while giving those that don't necessarily like spicy foods something enjoyable to snack on. With your help, we can take our finalized recipes through the steps necessary to reach a broader market. This includes things like purchasing new packaging, obtaining nutritional analysis, FDA approval, and ultimately producing an initial order large enough to fulfill Kickstarter rewards and have product on hand. As always, our jerky remains produced by hand in small batches free of nitrates, nitrites, and preservatives. We only use the best ingredients to maintain the highest level of quality. Thank you for your time and support, and we hope that with your help, we can keep growing and continue to providing all natural snacks.

 Speaker1: [00:00:07] Hi, I'm Brad. Thank you for taking the time to check out our Kickstarter page and learn a little bit more about our product. Hopefully this video will answer any questions you have, but feel free to shoot us a message if you'd like to know more. Simply put, Brave Jerky is handcrafted jerky for people who like spicy things. We constantly found ourselves on road trips, searching shelves at the local market for unique and spicy flavors of jerky. We were disappointed. Unfortunately, we were left with big box brands and very little choice. We asked around and found out we weren't alone, so we went to work. In addition to being a spicy alternative to otherwise bland flavors, Brave Jerky uses the freshest ingredients available and is always made with 100% USDA choice top round. We've developed flavors that vary in heat level, all while providing great flavor without the use of soy sauce or other overly salty marinades. We chose Kickstarter as a starting point because we love the community. Backers are often as creative and passionate about projects as the creators. We love watching projects take life. That's why we're backers ourselves. We need the funds to take Brave Jerky to the next level. We've taken a great amount of feedback, refined the recipes, and hammered out the methods. Now we're ready for the world to try it. We need your help getting there. The funds from this campaign will go directly back into the product. We'll be purchasing, packaging, labeling, and working directly with a locally and family owned kitchen to produce our recipes to scale, all while providing the oversight needed to maintain the quality that we demand. Again, thank you for taking the time out of your busy day to find out more about our project and helping us make our dream a reality. Please feel free to let us know if there are any questions we can answer.

 Speaker1: [00:00:00] Hi, my name is Matt Melnick and I'm the founder of Lawless Jerky, a small batch gourmet beef jerky company started right here on Kickstarter back in April. I'm back again, looking to raise funds to now grow the company. In this video, I'm going to be answering some questions sent in from our fans from around the country. And then I'm going to turn it over to some of our backers from the first project, talking about why they like lawless jerky in their own words.
 

 Speaker2: [00:00:23] Hi, I'm Steven, I got a question. What motivated you to do the first Kickstarter?
 

 Speaker1: [00:00:28] Yeah, I knew I had great recipes and plenty of passion, but just didn't have the money, and going on Kickstarter would be a great way to share the kickoff of my company with a dedicated following who could really be there through the journey, and it's really worked out that way. I've become Facebook friends, I've emailed with, and I've even met up with some of the backers.
 

 Speaker3: [00:00:52] My name is Mark and I'm an original lawless, jerky supporter. I want to ask Matt, were you surprised to hit your goal on Kickstarter so quickly?
 

 Speaker1: [00:01:00] Yes, I was definitely surprised to meet the goal in one day. I knew we had a chance to raise our goal. But never having been on Kickstarter, I just didn't know what it was capable of. But I have a really tight group of friends and family who came out for me right at the start of the Kickstarter project. And then the Kickstarter community chimed in, and eventually there were more backers donating more funds from the Kickstarter community than even people that I knew. And that was really validating and made me feel great.
 

 Speaker4: [00:01:27] Hi, I'm Heather, I'm from Kansas, and as a backer of Lawless Jerky, I just want to know where does Lawless Jerky stand as a business now?
 

 Speaker1: [00:01:35] Prior to the Kickstarter, we did not have a commercial product that we could sell. We did not have an e-commerce website. Now we have both, and we also have a handful of specialty and gourmet stores, bottle shops, and even a gym that's carrying our product.
 

 Speaker5: [00:01:50] Hi, my name is Catherine. I'm a big lawless, jerky fan. I used to ski, instruct, and eat jerky all the time, and I wanted to ask Matt, what brings you back to Kickstarter and what makes this project a sequel?
 

 Speaker6: [00:02:02] Yeah, this.
 

 Speaker1: [00:02:03] Campaign is really a sequel to the first campaign. In that Kickstarter, the VIP level backers were able to create some pretty interesting jerky flavors, which I then got in the kitchen and created recipes for. They came out so well that I need to bring them to the market ASAP. I want Lawless Jerky to grow. I want you to be able to go to a local retailer in your area and find it on the shelf. I want you to be able to say, hey, I helped make that happen. I help put lawless jerky on the map.
 

 Speaker7: [00:02:32] Kip Barnes, John Rockwell, Los Angeles ale works. So, Matt, we had a question for you. Your first Kickstarter was awesome with lawless jerky. Yeah. And now what do you expect to accomplish with the second Kickstarter?
 

 Speaker1: [00:02:44] I expect the Kickstarter community, friends and family to come out again to come out strong, and if not for me, then for their own taste buds. These three new flavors that we're going to be debuting are awesome. The first one is a Vietnamese pho flavor which is full of herbs. You've got cilantro, basil, jalapeno for a little bit of heat. I've got a paleo pepper flavor. It uses four different peppers a green, a white, a pink pepper which is really floral and savory, and then your standard black pepper. Finally, there's mango habanero. It's got a sweetness and it's got a heat to it. Together, it's really excellent. I personally want to give a special thanks to all 683 of my initial backers who have helped us get this far along, and everyone else who's given support along the way. But without further ado, enough of me. I hope you guys really enjoy these videos made by some pretty hardcore, lawless, jerky fans that good.

 Speaker1: [00:00:00] Hi, I'm Matt and I'm the creator of Lawless Jerky. The best beef jerky you've never had. Lawless jerky is not for weak, puny, or uninspired taste buds. It packs intense and complex flavor and lots of it. Our original flavor wasn't a simple, sweet, hot or pepper jerky. It was Japanese curry, a salty, sweet, and umami flavor. And it's the only Japanese curry beef jerky in the world. Don't believe me? Don't have to Google it. But lawless, jerky world of flavor doesn't stop in Asia. It starts there. We've got American barbecue, Hawaiian teriyaki and Thai chili, plus honey, chipotle and bacon, salt and pepper. You could go anywhere with lawless jerky. The Wild West was a lawless place. Home to big hopes, big dreams and big risks. Like early pioneers, I went west seeking opportunity. But not on a gold rush. I went to law school and became an attorney, all in pursuit of a legal career that I thought would fulfill my dreams. But before long it became clear to me that practicing law made me less happy. It was then that lawless jerky was born. Lawless jerky is so deliciously addictive that it should be illegal. Come to think of it, it is illegal in all 50 states, but not because of its killer flavor. You can't buy it, and I can't sell it because lawless jerky is not made in a USDA approved facility. But this can change. Nay, this must change. Future backers. That's where you come in. The goal of this project is to raise $12,000 to produce an initial batch of lawless, jerky, six flavors at a facility right here in California. Us of a. I have found my true calling, one that allows me to be both creative and entrepreneurial, one that allows me to be happy. If you support my efforts to make lawless, jerky law full jerky, your taste buds and yours truly will be forever grateful.

 Speaker1: [00:00:05] Then a snowboard trip in Tahoe, when a good friend gave me my first piece of homemade jerky and it was awesome. When I came back from the trip, I bought a dehydrator and made my own batch and shared it with friends and it actually went over really well. I never had any intention of starting a beef jerky business, but as I started making more and more jerky, people offered to pay me to make it for them. They liked my flavors so much more than what they were buying in the stores, and eventually friends were telling friends. Word was spreading fast around Long Beach. Chewy caught on quick, and right now it's expanding faster than I can continue to keep up with demand. What makes Crudo Beef different would definitely have to be the flavors. Most jerky today has a lot of unnecessary ingredients to prolong shelf life, and I just don't believe in doing that. Not a single chewy flavor has any steroids, growth hormones, MSG, nitrates, or added preservatives. Creating these recipes has become an art in its own kind of crafty way, and I can assure you these flavors will not disappoint. Right now, I have a booth at a farmers market in Long Beach, and it's pretty cool to see the response from people who have tried my jerky. They absolutely love it. There's nothing better than having customers come back each week to get their jerky fix. Unfortunately, Farmers Market is the only place I can sell true to beef. I just can't keep up with the demand right now to satisfy customers at the market and keep stores stocked with my bags. I'm a one man show with a lot of helpful friends who volunteer their time when available.
 

 Speaker1: [00:01:28] Buying supplies. Cutting and trimming the meat. Dehydrating. Bagging. I literally do everything with the help of a few friends. I need to free up more time so I can focus on things like marketing, gaining more accounts, and ultimately growing the business side of beef. So that's why I'm here. I need your help. I've poured all of my money to get through, to be where it's at today, and with your help, I can make it to the next step and make it a legitimate business. Luckily, I've partnered with a local certified kitchen that is just waiting for the green light on production. Every donation brings me one step closer to purchasing all the materials I need to get true beef off the ground and into the kitchen so we can keep up with the demand and start stocking our shelves with product. We've come up with some really great prizes, so you will be rewarded for any contribution you make. If you can't support right now, I completely understand, but it would mean a lot if you're able to share this video with your friends. At this point, everything helps. Thank you for taking the time to watch this video, and especially for those of you who donate. Like I said earlier, I've spent a lot of time getting to beef where it's at today. I believe in this business and I know with your help we can take it to the next step. So thank you. And with that, I want to leave you with a very special message from one of our biggest fans.

 Speaker1: [00:00:00] Hi, I'm Sean.
 

 Speaker2: [00:00:01] And I'm Nat, and we're the founders of Kiwi Super Snacks.
 

 Speaker1: [00:00:06] We've crafted a delicious, super healthy range of all natural jerky trail mixes. Each pack has a blend of 100% grass fed beef jerky, raw nuts and seeds, naturally dried fruit, and superfoods.
 

 Speaker2: [00:00:20] As Aussies that love the outdoors, we understand just how important it is to have the right fuel to sustain your adventures. Whether you're a competitive ultra marathoner, CrossFit athlete, or you're just looking for something healthy to eat at your desk, we've created an all natural, delicious snack with you in mind. Our jerky trail mixes are gluten, soy, and dairy free. They're paleo friendly and have no added sugar. Each pack contains at least 20g of natural protein and is loaded with antioxidants and essential nutrients. But before we go any further, let's talk a little more about our journey and why we need your help.
 

 Speaker1: [00:00:58] Juggling full time work while training for ultra marathons, I was always looking for healthy, convenient snacks to keep me going. I realized then and there that beef jerky would be the perfect high protein snack, if only it was made naturally and without the added sugar and preservatives. So I decided to make my own jerky using premium all natural ingredients with the goal of making it both healthy and delicious. We bought our dehydrator and started testing out different recipes at home until they were perfect. I started mixing the jerky with my homemade trail mix and would bring into work my latest creations to eat at my desk. It didn't take long for word to get out, and soon they were in high demand throughout the office.
 

 Speaker2: [00:01:38] Our weekends quickly became devoted to making our snacks, and it was while filling bags at 3 a.m. on a Sunday that we decided it was time to make our hobby a full time business. Chewy was born.
 

 Speaker1: [00:01:50] Originally, chewy was a call made by Indigenous Australians to communicate across vast distances, but today, chewy is used by all kinds of adventurers to express the freedom and exhilaration of being outdoors. It's this raw energy that we wanted to capture in our brand and share in every pack of our snacks.
 

 Speaker2: [00:02:10] We'll initially offer two delicious flavours. Our first smoked chipotle apple is a blend of smoky chipotle and spicy jerky mixed with naturally dried apple slices, raw nuts and seeds, and antioxidant rich cacao nibs. Our second flavor, lime pepper mango, contains a jerky seasoned with black pepper and infused with fresh lime juice. This is combined with dried, unsweetened mango, a blend of nuts and seeds, and dried goji berries.
 

 Speaker1: [00:02:39] Our jerk is made from whole cuts of only the finest quality, 100% grass fed beef sourced from the remote island state of Tasmania, Australia. All our beef has been sustainably raised on lush pastures by generations of proud Tasmanian farmers. Our beef is non-GMO and will always be free from added hormones and antibiotics.
 

 Speaker2: [00:03:00] By simply entering your product's code onto our website, you can even trace back each individual product to the exact Tasmanian farm where the beef was raised. We've even put special care into our packaging to tell you more. I'll throw to our team members Jamie and Pika in Colorado.
 

 Speaker3: [00:03:18] Hey, Kickstarter, whether you're on the trail or in front of your computer, we wanted to come up with a pack that was convenient and wouldn't leave you with sticky fingers.
 

 Speaker4: [00:03:27] That's why we designed our own unique rip peel mix pouch to maximize freshness. The jerky is stored in one compartment and the trail mix in the other. The special dividing seal peels away as you tear open the pack, allowing you to eat the ingredients all mixed together.
 

 Speaker3: [00:03:45] Back to you guys.
 

 Speaker1: [00:03:47] We're ready to roll. Our products are USDA approved. We've got a great team behind us. We have a manufacturer in California, and our packaging is ready to run off the printing press.
 

 Speaker2: [00:03:59] But we need your help to hit the ground running with your backing. We'll be able to finance our first commercial production run and bring this unique product to you guys, our fans.

 Speaker1: [00:00:11] Bright light city. Gonna set my soul. Gonna set my soul on fire. Hi, my name is Hans. I'm the founder of JoJo's jerky. Jojo's jerky started about 18 years ago. Ever since I moved out of my parents place. Actually, I was looking for a snack that I could take on the road, so I started making jerky at home. I started bringing it out to my friends and family. And actually how we got the name JoJo's. I used to bring over my jerky to my buddy Adam, and his son's name was Jonathan. I was Uncle Hans. Jonathan used to always ask Adam, hey, where is Uncle Hans? Like, is he going to bring me some jerky? Well, Jonathan's nickname was Jojo, so I always used to bring over jerky like a pound bag at a time, and he'd critique it for me, so he would tell me. Uncle Hans is too salty. It's too spicy, you know, whatever. And nonetheless, he'd always finish the bag. So back then I told him, this is about 12 years ago. I told him if I ever start a jerky company, I'll name it after him. So hence the name JoJo's. Jojo's was started. We just founded this last year, so 2012, and in one year's time, we've actually grown to a point where we're looking for some funds to actually bring it out to the masses. Bringing it out across the US and across the world. Las Vegas has been very good to us. They support us 110%. Any markets that we go to, we always have a line. We got our residual customers that come by get their weekly bag or three bags of jerky.
 

 Speaker1: [00:01:39] We can go out and do these markets and get an immediate feedback from our customers. That's why we have our following in Vegas. So they try our new flavors, they try our our original flavors, and they give us their feedback and all the time. 99% of the time it's wow, I've never tried anything like that. Your jerky is amazing, you know? How do you do it? First of all, we use all top sirloin. All of our beef comes from Greeley, Colorado. It's all natural. All fresh ingredients in our marinades. Our turkey jerky comes from Utah, so it's all natural. Turkey breasts. All fresh ingredients in those marinades as well. We do everything in house. So that means from butchering our beef to to hand trimming our turkey breast to all of our fresh marinades to. Packaging our product. The sky is the limit. We want to be that jerky company where it's an affordable product and an amazing product where you have more choices. So now we're at this point, and we're asking you for your help to bring Jojo to the masses. Jojo's jerky needs to be everywhere, and with your help, we'll be able to get USDA inspected and keep everything in-house. Not sending it out to some mass meat producer like other jerkies throwing nitrates and preservatives in. We don't want that. We want to keep everything fresh, natural, and with the best quality possible at the best price. Come pledge whatever you can. Try a bag. We're going to offer up our product. We're going to offer up all sorts of goodies. But try us out. Thank you for watching. Thank you for your support.",98.86,7,10,1.67,6,9

 Speaker3: [00:00:09] Fowler. I'm Angela's son.
 

 Speaker2: [00:00:12] Angela Fowler was an interesting kid because she didn't want to stop and eat ice cream. When she and her dad stopped at the convenience store, she wanted to get beef jerky.
 

 Speaker1: [00:00:21] I have a passion for making top quality beef jerky. Many people have told me this is the best beef jerky I've ever had. No artificial flavors. No artificial preservatives. Authentic homemade beef jerky made with top quality beef and natural ingredients.
 

 Speaker3: [00:00:43] And I've been with her through this whole experience of her making the jerky. And I've kind of seen firsthand how it's all went down.
 

 Speaker1: [00:00:53] And now I want to I want to take it commercial. I want to take this company to the next level.
 

 Speaker2: [00:00:58] She and her dad were absolutely passionate about beef jerky and the wonderful exotic flavors they could find in it. Soon enough. They were spending so much money on jerky that they decided, let's not keep buying this stuff, let's make it at home.
 

 Speaker1: [00:01:12] In fact, we kind of competed with each other to see who could make the best jerky, and it got so good that friends and relatives kept telling us, you know, you should sell this. You should sell this. And of course, we're thinking, no, come on, you guys are flattering us. But the idea sort of started to grow on us. So we sold it here and there, and my dad sold it to a couple people at work, and I sold it to a couple friends of mine, and we started getting some regular customers, people that bought every time we made jerky.
 

 Speaker2: [00:01:45] I met Angela at first in 2009, and she had just started selling some of her jerky to friends and family. I tried it and I loved it, and she kept selling to friends and family in a very small scale until 2012.
 

 Speaker1: [00:01:58] I was in school. I had a son to raise. My dad wasn't working, so he wasn't able to, you know, to help out.
 

 Speaker2: [00:02:08] She talked to me a lot as a good friend about can I make this a success? I mean, I don't know if I want to do this, if it's just going to be a lot of work and maybe not even pay for itself.
 

 Speaker1: [00:02:17] I'm not a business person. I'm not. I'm shy. I'm not good at going up to people and selling stuff.
 

 Speaker2: [00:02:28] I said, Angela, I believe in you. We're going to this huge blindness convention. I think you can sell enough jerky to pay your entire way and then some, and I'll even give you the cash to get started and get all the supplies. I gave her the cash. She got all the supplies. Her confidence built, her charisma built. Took that jerky to the convention. And she came home with no jerky but enough money to pay me back, pay for her trip and fund a month of living.
 

 Speaker1: [00:02:58] And I've been selling jerky at convention and on Facebook and to, you know, to a wider network ever since.
 

 Speaker2: [00:03:06] That was so exciting for me because I was able to help a friend believe in herself. More importantly, I think I gave her the confidence to know that she can succeed and she can go for it and try it.
 

 Speaker1: [00:03:16] I'm totally blind. I also have a significant hearing loss. And I know what it's like to have society look at me and say, oh, poor blind girl. You can't do much. But the truth is, I can. And we can. People with disabilities can can do jobs with equal skill as their non-disabled counterparts. And we're going to showcase that in my company. We're already partnering with people with disabilities.
 

 Speaker2: [00:03:47] She cares about disability. She cares about blindness. She cares about getting people to succeed.
 

 Speaker1: [00:03:53] And there are many Americans who went blind as a result of fighting for our country. And these folks have to adjust not only to losing their vision and learning to do things as a blind person does things, but they also have to adjust Just because they were in combat. They're traumatized. Therefore, I'm going to donate a portion of the proceeds from every bag of jerky we sell to help blinded veterans.
 

 Speaker3: [00:04:34] And she will not let her jerky be compromised in any way or be lacking in flavor or not have the texture and the exact purpose that it was meant for. And I can't wait to see the business progress further and just to see it take that next leap. And for her to be able to sell it commercially and on Amazon, and for a bunch of people to be able to get it and enjoy it, because I really think that it's the best jerky anyone's ever made.

With your help, we went from Chris's mom's kitchen to creating the most delicious low carb cookie you have ever tasted. Since then, your stories have inspired us to think bigger. You've transformed your mind and body, some of you losing over £100 in the process. We've met fathers who are helping their children manage type one diabetes through low carb diets, and we met mothers who are helping their children manage cancer by cutting out the sugar.
 

 Speaker2: [00:00:40] Being fueled by fat is life changing. I literally used to be that person that would eat every two hours, always be hungry, especially when I was dieting for a competition. It was just like up and down all the time. My energy levels would go up, I would be hungry and they would shoot weight out. So keto was like freeing from all of that. I also used to suffer from migraines and that went away and that was like, okay, this is game changing.
 

 Speaker3: [00:01:05] I've lost £40 since spring break and it's this is a diet I can stay on. And being able to have keto cookie really helps me when I do have a desire for sweets, I'm able to do something and not get the carbs up. Thanks again.
 

 Speaker1: [00:01:22] It is because of you that our mission has grown. You have shown us the true power of cutting out the carbs. With your help, we can make low carb and keto so easy that anyone can do it.
 

 Speaker4: [00:01:32] With the keto cookies. First and foremost, I eat what tastes good. Taste is king. I say that all the time and personal business and and whatnot. But the keto cookie, you don't feel as if you're depriving yourself or you're having to necessarily settle.
 

 Speaker1: [00:01:47] But we need your help. As a small company, we've run into a few challenges. We hand scoop, hand pouch, and hand ship each cookie, making the process labor intensive. We've quickly outgrown our bakery, and we're unable to get bulk discounts like other snack giants. Because of this, we've had to pass the cost on to you, our fans. But with your help, we can add more flavors, offer better pricing, and get keto cookies to your door even faster. By supporting our Kickstarter, you'll get early access to our unreleased flavors peanut butter and birthday cake, exclusive discounts, and once in a lifetime perks.

 Speaker1: [00:00:00] Hi, I'm Suzanne and I'm.
 

 Speaker2: [00:00:02] Jessica, and we're best friends, busy moms, and passionate about the ketogenic lifestyle.
 

 Speaker1: [00:00:08] We both started keto in 2015, and since then we've lost a combined £150. Not only did we lose the weight, but we feel so much better.
 

 Speaker2: [00:00:16] Back when we started, not many people had heard about keto, and there definitely were very few products on the market that were high quality and convenient. So we were doing a lot of cooking, a lot of baking, trying each other's recipes and really getting to know this way of eating.
 

 Speaker1: [00:00:32] In 2017, I launched my first book called Simply Keto, and the goal of that was to provide an easy guide to the keto diet with a lot of delicious recipes, and the response has been so heartwarming.
 

 Speaker2: [00:00:43] Although we love this way of eating, we definitely were missing something savory and crunchy, and everyone we talked to doing keto said the same thing.
 

 Speaker1: [00:00:51] So we started making the crackers in our home kitchens for our families and everyone who tried them absolutely loved them.
 

 Speaker2: [00:00:58] While we love these crackers, we really wish that we could just buy them off the shelf, rolling out the dough, getting the texture and the taste just right is really tedious.
 

 Speaker1: [00:01:07] So after countless ups and downs and lots of trial and error, Defy Foods was born.
 

 Speaker2: [00:01:13] We've been working on these crackers for the last two years, dialing in the recipes, working with manufacturers on production, creating, packaging, you name it.
 

 Speaker1: [00:01:21] And literally every single step along the way. Someone has told us that these crackers were absolutely impossible to produce, which just made us push forward even harder.
 

 Speaker2: [00:01:30] Along the way, we always stayed true to our goals. The crackers had to taste amazing, have high quality ingredients, and have low net carbs. And don't just take our word for it. Here's what a few others had to say.
 

 Speaker3: [00:01:42] We got a sneak peek of these new defy crackers.
 

 Speaker4: [00:01:48] They smell like Cheez-Its. These would go amazing on a cheese board. I just want to make a cheese board right now.
 

 Speaker3: [00:01:54] The crunch.
 

 Speaker4: [00:01:55] Yeah.
 

 Speaker3: [00:01:55] The crunch.
 

 Speaker4: [00:01:56] The flavor and the flavor. And these are like dense too. They're like really nice crackers.
 

 Speaker3: [00:02:00] So if you're looking to try something new guys definitely pick these up. I haven't tried anything quite like these yet.
 

 Speaker5: [00:02:04] One of the things I miss so often on a ketogenic diet is that crunch. And so you can only have so many pork rinds before you get burnt out. And Suzanne and the entire team at Defy Foods have created a solution with these crackers that not only taste delicious, but also are metabolically sound, meaning they're not going to spike your glucose, they're not going to spike your insulin. They're only made with good quality ingredients.
 

 Speaker6: [00:02:25] So it's that time of day when I feel like snacking on something, but I don't want to blow my keto diet. So thankfully, I've gotten my hands on these crunchy, yummy crackers made by my friends over at the Five Foods. And let me tell you. They're so yummy. Perfect snack.
 

 Speaker1: [00:02:42] We really embrace the idea of defining what traditional options were available and what a low carb cracker would taste like, and beyond crackers. We just wanted to really promote the idea of defying all obstacles and all odds that you come across in your life. And here's where we need your help.

 Speaker1: [00:00:02] I could definitely see myself eating quite a few of these.
 

 Speaker2: [00:00:06] Jessica started a ketogenic diet to improve her health. She loves that she can eat tasty food, but hates that she has little options when it comes to snacks and desserts. Some days she walks into a grocery store, only to be saddened and tempted as she stares down the aisles of ultra sugary, high carb cookies. She doesn't want to give in, but she craves something sweet.
 

 Speaker3: [00:00:27] I'm Chris and I'm Victor, and we felt the same pain when following our own low carb diets. We wanted a sweet treat we can enjoy anywhere, but we couldn't find any, and that's why we pulled out all of our savings to create Keto Cookie, the world's first ready to eat keto friendly cookie with less than one gram of net carbs and no added sugar, unlike sugar and gluten made cookies. Keto cookies are made with the finest ingredients almond flour, coconut and MCT oil, and organic pasture raised butter, and these are sweetened with natural sweeteners, which means you're not going to get any of that weird aftertaste. They're also wrapped in pears, so you can eat them on the go at work or at the gym. Keto cookies are gluten free, keto friendly, and great for diabetics.
 

 Speaker4: [00:01:13] It's really good. It's really soft, too.
 

 Speaker1: [00:01:17] In terms of texture. It's super, super creamy and fluffy at the same time. It's kind of amazing how it can do that both at the same time. I can imagine myself like.
 

 [00:01:25] Craving sweets all day and like wanting to go home and like eating this. It satisfies my sweet cravings.
 

 Speaker3: [00:01:31] So here's where we are today. We need $5,000 to help bring these amazing, life changing cookies to market. We're going to transform the way people look at low carb diets, and you are going to be a huge part of it. If you also love sweet treats, please support Keto Cookie today and start enjoying delicious low carb cookies.",62.68,7,8,2.04,5,10

 Speaker1: [00:00:01] Hi, I'm Kristen, I'm the creator of Boss Balls protein balls. So Boss Balls came to be when I was in my former career, I was a corporate traveler and I was traveling over 100 nights per year. The lifestyle caught up with me and I gained a bunch of weight. I hired a nutritionist and one of the best personal trainers in Miami, and I got to work. I come from a 20 year history of an eating disorder, where I have been bulimic since my teen years, and my weight got super low at one point. Once I started in my corporate career, my weight got super high. Once I started getting my nutrition under control and I started really getting into nutrition and learning a lot about what I needed to do in order to lose the fat that I wanted to lose. And I learned that I was not only not eating enough protein, but I was eating too much sugar. I needed to find a protein snack that I could take with me on the road to have in the airports and in the hotels, so that I wasn't running to the mini bar at night to grab the peanut M&Ms. I started looking for something that had really quality ingredients and was high protein, yet super low in sugar, and I couldn't find anything.
 

 Speaker1: [00:01:13] So that's when I decided to create it myself. And that's how boss bowls were born. When I started getting serious about nutrition and sticking to my fitness plan, the weight just started falling off. So within six months I lost £40 of fat. Not just weight, but fat. And my body completely started to change and along with it, my energy was up. I had my confidence back. I was feeling really great about myself, so I started making them for parties so that I could take something with me to make sure that I was staying on track. I then started giving them as gifts and the response was incredible. And it was then that I knew that I was on to something big. So I left my corporate job of ten years in order to grow the Boss Balls brand. What makes boss balls different nutritionally from other protein snacks out there is the ratio of protein to sugar, so each boss ball has between six and a half to seven grams of high quality protein, with less than one gram of sugar per ball. We started doing events all over the city of Miami.
 

 Speaker1: [00:02:21] We set up ten within a few week period at fitness facilities and gyms. Once we introduce boss balls to this demographic, we sold out at every single event that we did. The first week that we launched Boss Balls, it was incredible. We sold over 1000 boss balls to people all over the country. The orders were coming in faster than we could make them. Within the first month we sold over 5000. Okay, so we're ready to take boss balls to the next level. And that's why we're here, asking for your help. To do that, we're ready to take boss balls to production, to improve our packaging and our marketing in order to get us into major retailers and position us to have a presence at key industry trade shows. This journey that has led me to Boss Balls has truly changed my life. I really want to grow the brand and let many other people experience what Boss Balls can do for not only their nutrition, but their life in general. In joining the Boss Balls movement, I hope to be able to inspire you to reach your fullest potential and to handle your nutrition like a boss.",33.25,7,8,1.36,4,10

 Speaker1: [00:00:00] And so we're doing this Kickstarter because we know that everybody has their own personal mountain to climb, and we've come up with something pretty special. We've come up with these synergy bars. And the first ones have all the portable energy that Maria has tested and tried for physical and mental sustenance.
 

 Speaker2: [00:00:19] I climbed El Cap a few times now, and the challenge is always packing food with you that doesn't require a stove that is highly nutritious, tastes really good, so you're excited to eat it and has the right amount of calories to to fuel you up. Just really passionate about the fact that food is medicine. And how do we make food medicine? What does that look like? So I started delving into nutrition. Received a level one certification through Precision Nutrition just to find out more about how can we fuel our bodies in such a way where we're taking care of ourselves and we're healing ourselves and we're not you know, beating ourselves up or causing harm and actually creating more longevity. So to be able to put these bars out on the market and with that thought process in mind of it tasting delicious and trying to make sure that we're putting the right things in people's bodies, that's going to sustain them and give them longevity.

 Speaker1: [00:00:06] Last year, we launched enter with one mission to provide healthy and sustainable protein for the planet. Here's why. The world today faced many challenges, including food insecurity. The world population will increase to 10 billion people by 2050. This means that we must increase our current food production by 70%. But we cannot increase our food production without further depleting our resources. There are sustainable solutions to this problem, including reduced food wastage, more plant based diets, or consuming alternative protein sources. This is not a storage facility, nor a warehouse. Nope. This is where we farm one of the planet's most natural and sustainable food source. Crickets. Now, you probably have come across people eating crickets or other bugs on TV, but it turns out crickets are yummy. Still not convinced? Our crickets are highly nutritious. Our crickets have more protein than beef. More iron than kale. More dietary fiber than oatmeal, and much more. For me, crickets is also highly sustainable. It requires less water, land. Feed and emit fewer greenhouse gases. Now let's talk about how our delicious snacks are made. We slow roast our crickets under low heat, and we roast in small batches to ensure that it tastes delicious every single time. We then add our secret blend of spices and package it in recyclable kraft paper bags. The end result? We created three amazing flavors. Wondering how it tastes? Zion will show you.
 

 Speaker2: [00:02:21] Cricket snacks. You've probably seen it in Thailand before. Awesome.
 

 Speaker3: [00:02:26] Interesting. Yeah. Hello.

 Speaker1: [00:00:00] What if we told you you could have the most incredible Mediterranean vacation of your life simply by opening a bag of chips? Well, you can't, but we have the next best thing. Introducing Picasso, the Mediterranean chickpea chip. Let's rewind a little. Picasso was born from our fascination with the Mediterranean lifestyle. We dreamt of incorporating the sunny, stress free attitude into everyday life. So we decided to take a closer look. The first thing we noticed was that these folks loved to eat. And boy do they know how to please their taste buds. The second thing we noticed was that they all seemed to be in really great shape. How is that possible? It turns out it's not all that complicated. It starts with using simple ingredients like olive oil and chickpeas. Not to mention the fact that they always choose quality over quantity. Thousands of years of cooking experience sure do pay off, but how could we possibly integrate these ancient traditions and recipes into our everyday lives? Enter Picasso. We not only created a delicious, crispy Mediterranean chip. We developed a highly nutritious super snack, naturally packed with fiber and twice as much protein as potato or corn chips. And the best part is, you don't even have to be on a sunny beach or in a picturesque village to enjoy them. Picassa chips will keep you feeling full and energized anywhere your active life might take you. Thanks, chickpeas and thank you Mediterranean. So we might not be able to promise you a mediterranean vacation in a bag, but we can promise you that our chickpea chips will take your taste buds on the trip of a lifetime.
 

 Speaker2: [00:02:09] For the last year, we've been making chips by hand and selling them at farmers markets, but we haven't been able to keep up with demand. That's why we are so excited to bring Picasso Chickpea Chips to you on Kickstarter. As a backer of Picasso. You'll be helping us make our handcrafted chickpea chips into something we can scale and serve to anyone looking for a better snack. We're actually making chips in a brand new way, and we have to invest in specialty equipment so that we can make our chickpea chips with simple ingredients without having to add any additives or grains. Please support and share our campaign with your friends and family on social media to help us make this dream a reality. Thanks for checking us out and we can't wait to share Picasso Chickpea Chips with you!",98.77,7,18,1.95,4,8

 Speaker1: [00:00:00] It's that time of day you're craving something sweet and slightly indulgent. It's only natural. But you want something that's delicious, nutritious, not too filling and quick. Yeah, that was me too. So my mom did something about it. Introducing the Milk Chew, a not too sweet, chewy milk treat with benefits inspired by a traditional Asian treat. My mom grew up eating but 100% natural with less sugar and more vitamins. Just as my mom did in her kitchen, we make them with six simple, fresh and functional ingredients nothing artificial and no preservatives. The result is a chewy delight that tastes like candy but performs like a bar. That means, compared to one of the leading granola bars in America, we have more protein, more vitamins, and less calories and fat. Meanwhile, we have just enough sugar the same as that granola bar, by the way, and far less than that standard candy bar to satisfy that sweet tooth. Our shoes are popularly not too sweet because the main sweetener we use is maltose, a natural sweetener distilled from fermented grains that's 50% less sweet than table sugar. We source our maltose from China, where waste grains are used to produce it the traditional way, which was used since ancient times and preserves a higher content of iron and fiber. But what about taste? Milky. Creamy. Nutty. Complex.
 

 Speaker2: [00:01:22] Like many people have said, they never have something like this before.
 

 Speaker1: [00:01:27] That, or they say that. It reminds them of a of a favorite childhood candy. But healthy. And that's just our original flavor. We've been working on two exciting new flavors chocolate milk with peanuts and strawberry milk with real dried strawberries. Each chew is individually packaged and at only 55 calories each. They're perfect on the go as a pre post workout snack for travel for the little ones or at work. The name Numa comes from the Chinese characters for daughter and mother. Because our story started in my mother's kitchen and that is what we strive to honor in our snacks. We've come a long way from our first batch in our own kitchen, but we're just getting started. We need your help to reach more people and to expand our product lines and capacity.

 Speaker1: [00:00:00] Sometimes it's the snacks we love dearly that hurt us the most. This can be a difficult truth to face and denial is a natural first reaction.

 Speaker1: [00:00:21] White flour. After that, there's bargaining.
 

 Speaker2: [00:00:28] Blue corn chips. Blue corn is healthier than yellow corn. Veggies.

 Speaker2: [00:00:48] This body is only good for three months anyway, so.
 

 Speaker3: [00:00:53] We invented the egg white chip to help save people from this vicious snacking cycle. One day I realized that these crispy bits of cooked omelette crunched like a chip. Yeah, there's so much healthier than the other options available. With egg whites as their primary ingredient, we were able to create a snack with an incredible macronutrient profile. Huevos have ten grams of protein. Bean chips have four. Cuevas has six grams of fiber. Kale chips have three. And when we say made from egg white, we mean as a type one diabetic. The idea of a snack made for egg whites was particularly appealing to me, because it offered the possibility of having so few carbs that I could avoid doing an insulin injection. We turned that possibility into a reality by developing a few extremely low carb flavors, with only 2 to 3 net carbs per bag, perfect for diabetics and keto dieters. In addition to these stellar macronutrients, our snack is made from all natural, gluten free, lactose free, and soy free ingredients so everyone can join the party. We developed a line of delicious flavors. Our keto flavors are Cuervos Rancheros and sour cream and onion flavor, and our new flavors are barbecue and cheddar flavor. Here's the rub. We can't do this alone. Developing the perfect healthy snack takes time, energy, and resources. That's why we dropped out of college to start this company. That's why we've seized a room in my parents house for order fulfillment. That's why we're living in my parents basement. And that's why we need your help to fund our first large scale production line that includes new packaging and ingredients for our improved version of Cuervos, as well as a few new flavors, which you'll be the very first to try.

 Speaker5: [00:01:20] Hi, my name is Eli Hansen, and I'm the founder of Keen Protein. I created Keen Protein Bars because I couldn't find a healthy snack or protein bar that didn't have soy or other food allergens in it. You see, a little over a year ago, I was having a lot of stomach pain and food was getting stuck in my throat. Eventually, I saw an allergen specialist. Allergen specialist told me I'm allergic to soy and walnuts, which was surprising because as a kid, I didn't have any food allergies growing up. Once I found out I was allergic to soy, I started looking at everything I was eating and I noticed that soy is in a lot of things we eat. I found it in my chewing gum and I even found it in my vitamin D pills. I took a recipe that a family member had given me. I hadn't thought much about it for protein bars. I tweaked that recipe so that I could come up with a healthy snack that was allergen free. I created the Kenan Protein Bar. We have our Sunflower Bar, which is top eight allergen free.
 

 Speaker5: [00:02:14] It has no dairy, eggs, gluten, soy, peanuts, tree nuts, fish, or shellfish. And I created our almond bar, which is top seven allergen free. It has a single allergen tree nuts, almonds, a peanut butter dark chocolate chip and a peanut butter bars have our top seven allergen free and have a single allergen. So far, the bars have been successful. People love them in order to mass produce them and get them to everybody. We have to go to a co-packer and Co-packer is expensive. In this case, it's even more challenging because we have a bar that's completely allergen free and other bars that have a single origin. We have to avoid cross-contamination and that's a challenge. That's where you come in. We need your help to support our Kickstarter so that we can help bring clean protein bars to the masses so that everyone can stay clean. All right. I'm here in one of the local Salt Lake City area gyms with Michelle. She's going to try the sunflower seed allergen free Keene Protein Bar and give us a reaction.

 Speaker1: [00:00:04] Hi, I'm Wesley Cooper, founder of Neo Bytes, a company on a mission to save the environment through alternative food solutions. Everything we do has an impact on our planet, and that goes all the way down to the foods we eat. Neo bytes was formed as a solution to feed a rapidly increasing population and offer a sustainable alternative to an archaic system that's harming our planet. By 2050, the world's demand for meat products will have more than doubled. In meeting this demand with traditional solutions will not be sustainable long term. On top of that, the world's top five meat and dairy corporations combined produce more greenhouse gases than Exxon, shell or BP. And looking at our food system objectively, we basically chose a handful of animals to get our protein from. It's time we introduced something more sustainable to the mix. We're launching with our Protein Cookie Bites, made up of our sustainable protein flour blend that contains oat flour, cricket powder, and pea protein. Oats and peas are already widely accepted as sustainable alternatives, but crickets have yet to be fully adopted into the Western diet due to their perceived yuck factor. Even though this protein source is extremely nutritious and sustainable, crickets use fractions of resources when compared to meat products. These less water, less land, less feed, and they produce more edible weight, meaning less waste.
 

 Speaker1: [00:01:21] On top of that, they also produce virtually no greenhouse gases or ammonia and can reproduce much faster than large mammals. Crickets are also one of the most high quality alternative protein sources to mainstream staples. They contain all nine essential amino acids, more omega three seconds in beef, more iron than spinach, more calcium than a glass of milk. And they also contain vitamin B12, which is a vital nutrient that's missing from most vegan diets. Not to mention, eating insects is not a new idea. Humans have a long history of eating insects, and even today, people in 80% of countries in the world regularly consume insects as both a staple and a delicacy. We've created a product that's balanced in protein, fats and carbs, is low in sugar and calories, and is jam packed with nutrients. A serving of Neo Bites Protein Cookie Bites packs 11g of protein in only 250 calories. They are free from soy, artificial preservatives, and sweeteners, and they are considered vegan, which means they are entirely plant based except for the cricket powder. Also, they're delicious. But don't take my word for it. Just listen to some of the people who already love Neo Bites.

 Speaker1: [00:02:58] With the introduction of both Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods, we've started to see a major shift in the right direction, and growth in consumer adoption of these alternatives is outstanding. We've nailed down a great tasting, sustainable product, put it behind packaging and branding that's edgy and sleek. With all that said, we won't be able to achieve our vision without your help. We're asking for $30,000 to cover initial operating costs. These funds will allow us to commercially produce our first batch of Neo bites that will cover ingredients, our packaging, commercial kitchen rental, storage space, licensing, and other miscellaneous production costs that might come up along the way. We don't think crickets are the solution, but we think they're part of it. And our protein cookie bites are just the beginning. We have exciting innovations and development and we can't wait to share them with you. Thank you. And check us out at Eat Neo Bites com.",68.85,10,10,1.02,7,10

 Speaker1: [00:00:00] The problem. Ice cream? Sure, it tastes great. Everybody loves it. And then you eat it and you feel guilty and ashamed and remorseful and disgusted and fat and bloated. My God, who needs that? Holy cow. Speaking of cows, you got skinny cow and its diet ice cream, but it's full of ingredients that you can't even pronounce. For gosh sakes, you got your monoglycerides, sorbitol, sodium carboxymethyl something or another. I mean, seriously, you want to put that in your body? I don't think so. Then you got pro rich cream bars. This is all natural, non-GMO food ingredients. Does it get any better than that? Well, yes it does, because it also has ten grams of protein, 26 vitamins and minerals, three grams of fiber, and probiotics in every serving. It's sort of like a sports nutrition bar meets ice cream. They hook up and have a baby, and the baby is Courage cream bars. Why don't you check this out? Okay, so you saw the video. Do you get it? Do you have, you know, a good idea of what it is we're doing here? It's amazing. It's innovative. There's no other product on the market like it. So if you backed our project, we want to say thank you very sincerely. If you did not back our project, what do you have rocks in your head. Do you understand? Ten grams of protein 26 vitamins and minerals, three grams of fiber, all non-GMO food ingredients. No weird names.

 Speaker1: [00:00:14] Hi Kickstarter, my name is Kristina and I'm here to talk about jerky, crisp, thin, crispy, and delicious jerky. But first let me introduce you to the founders of Jerky Crisp, ROM and Asa.
 

 Speaker2: [00:00:29] Hi, my name is rom. My passion is making beef jerky. Started a few years ago when a friend of mine started complaining about how hard it is to eat beef jerky, how thick they were, how chewy they were, and especially with a lot of preservatives. So this is when Jerky Crisp comes in. So I'm going to hand you over to Asa and Christina so they can take you to a little tour. Again, thank you for all your support.
 

 Speaker3: [00:00:53] Hi, my name is Asa Sang, and I'm the co-founder of Jerky Crisp. Thank you for watching our video and supporting our campaign. We look forward to more of your feedback and also bringing our product to the general market and to the mass.
 

 Speaker1: [00:01:07] Back in 2007, ROM started making jerkies that are not only out of this world delicious, but are also more convenient and less difficult to eat. Word spread and people were offering to pay for his jerkies. Eventually, large orders began rolling in and trying to keep up with demand without the proper equipment became a nightmare. That's when Rom's friend and co-founder, Asa, convinced him to seek a producer to make his tasty jerkies. He was a collaborative effort of Asa's business expertise and Rom's epic jerky making skills. They formed Jerky Crisp Corporation despite their diligent effort. The business of making jerkies require more funds than they anticipated. And folks, this is the reason why they need your help. So what makes ramen Asses jerky so unique? Well, let me tell you, they are half the thickness of ordinary jerkies with crispy texture and they are made only with the best ingredients. Jerky. Crisp jerky comes in six different flavors. They've got butter mesquite, which you can taste the combination of the butter and the mesquite with other blend of seasonings that will accommodate any palate. Ruby red chili. This flavor is seasoned with red chili and is packed with lots of heat. So if you love dragon heat, spicy and the aroma of red chili, then this is the flavor for you. Zesty green chili. This flavor has a well-balanced amount of spices for just the right amount of kick, so Zesty Green chili is perfect for folks who like it mild. Cracked pepper. This one has a nice balance of musky, earthy aroma and a mild punch of black pepper that will get your taste buds prancing.
 

 Speaker1: [00:02:42] This flavor is great for those who like a subtle combination of spice and aroma. Salt. This is your traditional blend of seasonings with sprinkles of salt to bring out that wholesome beef flavor. So if you appreciate that simple, original taste of beef jerky, then salt is the flavor for you. Last but not least, we've got Jalapeno Crunch. This one is my personal favorite. For those of you who love the jalapeno taste and spiciness like I do, then this is what you've been missing all your life, I tell you. This one is packed with both heat and flavor. Aside from ramen AC's passion for fine quality and delicious jerkies, they are also passionate about giving back. A certain percentage of proceeds will be donated to water for Cambodia. Water for Cambodia is a non-profit organization whose mission is to provide clean drinking water to underdeveloped villages in Cambodia. For more information, please visit water for Cambodia website at water for Cambodia. Org. In future, Prospect Ramen ASA hope to extend their passion of giving back to more non-profit organizations in both our communities and other third world countries. But this hope will only be realized with your help and support through continuous purchase and spreading of the word about jerky Jerkies. Not only will you be enjoying the uniquely delicious jerky, but you will also feel good about it.
 

 Speaker4: [00:04:13] So I'm here trying now to, you know, jerky, crisp. It's really impressed me so far. I'm a big, salty snack eater. I've always got some kind of you know, sunflower seeds or beef jerky in my desk. And so I got an opportunity to try this, and I got to tell you that the stuff's great. A lot of the the beef jerky you find in the store is just dunked in teriyaki sauce or covered in chili peppers. And I think these guys spent some more time putting some thought into their flavors, and they're really genuine. And the texture of this stuff is just off the charts. It's like nothing you ever tasted before.
 

 Speaker5: [00:04:52] Rob, thank you for letting me try your jerky, Chris. It's really amazing. It's really good. I tried your jalapeno jerky. It was really good. Can't wait to try out the rest of your flavor.",79.03,7,12,1.59,6,10

 Speaker5: [00:01:26] So this is the future of snacks.
 

 Speaker4: [00:01:31] Yes, the mix contains raw almonds, cashews, and walnuts, along with dried fruit to complement our savory jerky, creating an umami flavor that's hard to resist.

 Speaker5: [00:01:45] How did you get the DVD?

Warning meat nuts contains no MSG or sodium nitrate, no gluten, no high fructose corn syrup, no antibiotics or hormones administered. Possible allergens include almonds, cashews, and walnuts.

 Speaker1: [00:00:01] When we started jerky. Com, what we wanted to do was make a place where jerky enthusiasts could come and buy a higher quality, better selection of products than they could get at their local store. All the jerky. Com products are all natural, and they're made with no artificial ingredients, no hormones, no growth stimulants, no antibiotics, just good stuff. Not only do we have a great selection of the staples beef jerky, turkey pork jerky, but we have a wide range of exotics like venison, buffalo, alligator, ostrich, wild boar, even kangaroo. And we've got a couple specialty jerkies bacon jerky and our world famous pineapple jerky. So primarily our business is built on online sales. Recently, at the urging of some of our local customers, we've started participating in some local events, such as farmers markets and things like that around town. We really enjoy it. We have a lot of fun, we meet a lot of really cool people, and we slang a little bit of jerky in the process. So here's our idea we want to make the coolest jerky truck on the planet. So we decided to buy a van. Not that van. This van. We want to make this an exciting and fun experience for the community, and we definitely want it to be the coolest thing at the farmer's market. We bought this goofy looking 1993 Daihatsu minivan straight from Japan, complete with right hand steering wheel and all. It's got the front end of a van, the back end of a truck. I guess it's like Japan's version of the El Camino. People stop us, flag us down, even come running across parking lots just to ask us about this goofy little truck.
 

 Speaker1: [00:01:42] So we think it's perfect. And we haven't even started with it yet. We have the truck. I think that's a great start. Now we just need some customization to make this thing the baddest jerky truck on the planet. We're planning on building a fold out, transforming, jerky display that opens up out of the back end of this truck. The money's going to be used to build these displays and the custom built topper that goes on the back end. So our goal with this Kickstarter project is to make this thing a fully functional, jerky store. We're working with a complete custom car shop that is going to completely remake this van. They're going to create the display, the topper, and the suspension work to support all the additional weight. And any additional money is going to be put right back into the truck to make it even more badass. We're talking custom paint, custom interior, custom wheels and tires, a complete custom audio and video system. This thing's going to be pretty cool. We want to do more than just a boring food truck. We think jerky deserves better than that, and we hope you do too. So we've got some great reward packages put together to help make your pledging decision easy. All of our rewards come with our world famous jerky, and our early bird specials allow you to get them at a deep discount. So I've been enamored with Kickstarter since day one, and I'm excited to launch my first project. We really look forward to your support and please leave us your comments below. Thank you.",96.37,7,9,2.02,8,10

 Speaker1: [00:00:04] These are all the ingredients that go into one small batch of brothers. Tom kha gai jerky. We thought this traditional Thai dish would make great jerky. We were right. It does. Jerky, at its core is a vessel for flavor that it's healthy, portable, and protein rich is all secondary to its versatility as a flavored delivery vehicle. It's like a rickshaw, but for your taste buds. Most jerky is mass produced in giant, factory concocted batches loaded with artificial ingredients. Brothers is anything but that. We take a test kitchen approach to making every flavor we have absolutely no interest in conforming. We're here to make something wild and new. Not everything we test makes the cut, but that doesn't stop us from trying. Between discarded batches, we perfected our Korean barbecue. We pulverize pistachios and lemon peel to create a lamb shawarma that smacks of the meat you see carved off those giant cones at state fairs. Regular jerky is a frat house. Tepid domestic light beer in a red plastic cup. Brothers is hard liquor. Brothers is like a scene in a movie where two cool guys walk away from an explosion in slow motion. The company is called brothers because it was founded and run by two brothers. People underestimate jerky. It functions beautifully, not merely as a snack, but as an ingredient. If done well, it can infuse the flavors of our planet's most iconic dishes into a delicious chunk of meat.
 

 Speaker2: [00:01:38] That's where I come in. I care about the way things taste, how they make me feel. I value endorphins, serotonin, all that happy brain stuff. I've been force fed the same handful of safe and uninteresting, jerky variations for decades. As a result, people underestimate what jerky can be. After eating this, how could anyone want to eat that?
 

 Speaker1: [00:01:56] We go to the ends of the earth for the meat and the spices. No tribal hut too far. No back alley. Kitchen too small. We make ten recipes for every one that makes the cut. We explore, create, taste, and iterate to put unconventional, delicious world flavors in every bag of brothers. We are brothers. Artisanal. We will never cease to tinker. And we will never surrender.

 Speaker2: [00:00:23] Hey, I'm Paul, and I'm the founder of Power Plant. We make organic eggplant jerky. A few years ago, I was at a friend's potluck, and I tried this amazing dish that had the texture and taste of bacon. It blew my mind. Not long after that, I was volunteering at a biodynamic farm picking vegetables. That fall happened to be a banner year for eggplants, so I brought them home and started working on my own recipes. Not long after that, I moved into a community kitchen space and started working on finalizing four flavors barbecue, sweet, Sriracha, teriyaki, and Hickory Maple. Next came packaging. I designed these custom rubber stamps so I could hand stamp every bag DIY style. Unfortunately, now they're just way too many bags to stamp by hand. And that's where I'm asking.
 

 [00:01:18] For your help.
 

 Speaker2: [00:01:25] I'm working on amazing custom designed packaging for power plant. This will not only increase sales, but this will streamline our production process and allow me to continue growing this company and bringing this amazing product to people who really want it. Today, we make our organic eggplant jerky at Rainbow Acres in Inglewood, California. We're available in independent natural food stores all around Southern California, and we're growing quickly. But this story really isn't about me. It's about the animals. We can eliminate the unnecessary suffering of all our animal friends. In addition to reducing the pollution from animal agriculture, which contributes to climate change. And you can also heal your body. Thank you everybody so much for watching and thank you for your generous support. There's so much more to do with Power Plant. I believe in this company very, very much.

 Speaker2: [00:00:51] And after almost two years of R&D, we finally have it ready.
 

 Speaker1: [00:00:54] Sated shakes are a complete meal in a bottle. They have as much protein as three eggs, as much potassium as two bananas, more calcium than a cup of milk, more fiber than a bowl of oatmeal, and as much omega three as 15,441 chia seeds.
 

 Speaker2: [00:01:12] Yes, he actually counted.
 

 Speaker1: [00:01:14] And they taste pretty good too.
 

 Speaker3: [00:01:19] It's definitely the best meal replacement shake out there, and no one's paying me to say this. If I can.
 

 Speaker4: [00:01:23] Just grab something from the fridge and just drink it as my breakfast.
 

 Speaker5: [00:01:26] Game changer. There are moments where it's just like I can do a quick chug and go, if you will. And that just makes me feel full.
 

 Speaker6: [00:01:33] It opens up a lot of possibilities without having to spend a lot of time. And when you're traveling or you're trying to work on more important things. Time is money.
 

 Speaker7: [00:01:40] I'm a mechanic and sometimes I don't have time to go eat, eat. And that's why I was looking for a meal replacement. And their stuff tastes great and it fit the bill for me.
 

 Speaker8: [00:01:49] You can take it and throw it in your luggage. You can throw it in your gym bag. You can throw it in your purse.
 

 Speaker9: [00:01:54] We have busy lives, and sometimes you can't just prep it all and take it with you.
 

 Speaker10: [00:01:57] I'm really impressed with the growth and evolution that I've seen so far, and just the overall taste of everything.
 

 Speaker1: [00:02:02] When I started a low carb keto diet, I lost £35 in seven months and experienced a life changing improvement in chronic pain.
 

 Speaker2: [00:02:09] And Ted's not alone. Customers write in every week to tell us how reducing their carbs has changed their lives, which.
 

 Speaker1: [00:02:14] Is why we're so excited to finally have a ready to drink version of our shakes. It's going to make watching your carbs effortless.
 

 Speaker11: [00:02:21] Having something like an RTD or something that can really benefit them from a bigger capacity and grab it on the go can really allow them to maintain this lifestyle.
 

 Speaker12: [00:02:31] I don't feel like I need to eat all the time. Something I really enjoy.
 

 Speaker10: [00:02:35] So I visited their warehouse, seen all of their production facilities and all that. And it's a great team. They're developing great products.
 

 Speaker13: [00:02:41] A lot of what's happening now, the innovation and products like stated, you're at a great place to be. I'm excited.
 

 Speaker4: [00:02:48] For an RTD drink.
 

 Speaker10: [00:02:49] Bottle a day keeps the doctor away.
 

 Speaker1: [00:02:54] We're ready to start production, and we'd love for you to be a part of our very first run.
 

 Speaker2: [00:02:58] That's where this campaign comes in. As a thanks for your support. We're offering early adopters significant discounts, and we're so confident you'll love our shakes. They come with 100% money back guarantee.
 

 Speaker1: [00:03:09] Excited. We're working hard to make eating well and watching your carbs stress free, and I really hope you'll join us. It's frustrating because if we had enough time, I'd really love to contextualize the product in the broken modern food system.
 

 Speaker14: [00:03:25] And really, you want to start the story 5000 years ago.
 

 [00:03:32] If I had enough time, I.
 

 Speaker14: [00:03:33] Think that's what I'd like to say.
 

 Speaker2: [00:03:34] But we've discussed this already. There's not enough time. We should just stick to the script.
 

 [00:03:41] Okay? Hi. I'm Ted.",76.43,7,10,1.38,5,9

 Speaker1: [00:00:04] Looking for low carb, keto friendly snack options is a tough task. The benefits of eating this way are undeniable, but it just seems like grocery stores haven't caught on yet. If you're like us, you know the struggle of searching for keto friendly options.
 

 Speaker2: [00:00:20] Time after time, label after label, nothing will fulfill our cravings. We knew we wanted something that's low carb but also tastes delicious. Flavor is so important for us, and it seems like everything we could find online just wasn't very good.
 

 Speaker1: [00:00:38] Of course, making our own snacks was always an option, and there are some great keto recipes out there. But with our busy lifestyle, we don't have the time. We wanted something convenient and ready to go.
 

 Speaker2: [00:00:52] Hi guys! My name is Aideen.
 

 Speaker1: [00:00:54] And I'm Dave. We're the co-founders of Rebel Snacks. We've been keto for a few years now and we know how common this experience is. We share a passion for keto and we want to help others. Aside from the health benefits of eating low carb, it's the mental and energy benefits of keto that have us really excited. Keto is not going away anytime soon and there needs to be better options.
 

 Speaker2: [00:01:21] So we started experimenting in our kitchen with simple ingredients that would fit our killer lifestyle.
 

 Speaker1: [00:01:27] We had four main criteria when we started making snacks for ourselves. First, it had to be low carb and truly ketogenic.
 

 Speaker2: [00:01:36] Second, it had to taste amazing. Like a lot better than everything that we had tried before. So no weird aftertaste from ingredients like stevia or weird chalky gummy textures. We basically wanted it to be as good as any dessert out there.
 

 Speaker1: [00:01:55] The third criteria we had was that we could only use clean ingredients that we could be proud of. This means no weird sweeteners like maltitol, no artificial ingredients, and no tapioca fiber syrups that disguise as true fibers.
 

 Speaker2: [00:02:11] And last but not least, we wanted it to be convenient and ready to eat. So after many months of trying this recipe in our kitchen, we realized how good it was.
 

 Speaker1: [00:02:22] We also realized it's something that needed to be shared with others. And soon after Rebel Snacks was born.
 

 Speaker2: [00:02:55] So guys, we are super excited to share our bikes with you! This is a new kind of keto snack, one that actually tastes delicious. We like to think of these as a revolution in snacks.
 

 Speaker1: [00:03:07] With your help, we're launching this Kickstarter campaign. This investment will allow us to get packaging so that we can ship Rebel Snacks to you wherever you are, in a fast and effective manner. If you believe in our mission, please support this Kickstarter so that we can keep this revolution growing.
 

 Speaker3: [00:03:28] My wife's Cheeto.
 

 Speaker4: [00:03:31] That is very good. Whoa.
 

 Speaker5: [00:03:33] One of the challenges that I always have every day is, is I have a tendency to just kind of bloat up on protein. Yeah. And I'm in the middle of the day. I'm like, I need more fats. I need.

 Speaker1: [00:00:03] Hi, I'm Doctor Tracy and I'm James, and we're the co-founders of Cetology, the most delicious, all natural keto shakes in the world.
 

 Speaker2: [00:00:10] We got into this way of eating back in 2014, when we first discovered the amazing health benefits of eating low carb, healthy fat foods. As a health psychologist and researcher, I was used to studying the medical literature and kept finding more and more evidence that suggested our family would benefit from cutting out sugar and carbs. We just couldn't ignore the science. And with a family history of type two diabetes and CVD, we knew what we had to do.
 

 Speaker1: [00:00:36] But like everyone else, we found there were very few options for people leading super busy lives. Making keto food from scratch was delicious for sure, but it was also time consuming, expensive, and not exactly convenient. When we're on the go, which, let's face it, it's pretty much all of the time these days.
 

 Speaker2: [00:00:53] It was also very easy to get it wrong and waste valuable ingredients trying to make a recipe, only to have it turn out tasting either chalky or bland or too sweet. Someone had to do something to make keto easier, more delicious, and more convenient.
 

 Speaker1: [00:01:08] We felt so passionate about this mission. We sold our house in New Zealand and moved to Dallas, Texas.
 

 Speaker2: [00:01:14] Then we spent over a year interviewing more than 50 suppliers to make sure they could deliver on our unique vision. We were determined that our products would be what we like to call clean keto, meaning ultra low net carbs, of course, but also using only organic plant sweeteners, 100% pure grass fed collagen peptides for easy digestion, and healthy fats from our custom made coconut oil powder. We did also do some trials using MCT oil powder, but it was not very gut friendly. Our commitment has always been to use real food ingredients in our shakes, like dark Dutch cocoa, and never use sucralose or any other artificial flavors or sweeteners. And you can definitely taste the difference. When we sampled our shakes at Keto Con in Austin last year. The consensus was loud and clear everybody loved them.
 

 Speaker1: [00:02:05] So here's the important thing you need to know. Since last July, we've been selling our amazing, delicious keto shakes and the response has been unbelievable. Every day we get emails and Facebook messages from people who love what they've done for their health. Some people have lost a ton of weight. Others have driven down their a-1c to pre-diabetic levels. Others have reported more stable moods, more energy, sharper brain function, clearer skin, and even better sleep.
 

 Speaker2: [00:02:31] But we need to do even more. Currently, our shakes are only available in large jars, which costs more than many people can afford or are willing to risk, especially if they want to try more than one flavor.
 

 Speaker1: [00:02:43] Another major problem is portability. It's all good having a big jar to use at home, but what about for work or going to the gym? Or if you're getting on a flight?
 

 Speaker2: [00:02:52] What people need is for us to make our nutritious keto shakes available in single servings. This is where we need your help. We can make our shakes an option for many more people if we can simply get them into convenient single serve sachets. This is by far the best solution. The only other option would be to put the powder into plastic bottles, but this is just so wasteful. We did that as a trial, but found it was super inefficient, costing the consumer a lot more due to larger shipping boxes and costing the environment big time with throwaway single use plastic bottles.
 

 Speaker1: [00:03:26] Single serve sachets are lighter, smaller and no plastic caps either.
 

 Speaker2: [00:03:31] But to make the printed film, we have to make thousands at a time. Long story short, we need your help to make this possible.
 

 Speaker1: [00:03:39] So here's the plan. We've put together several different levels of rewards for this campaign to suit all different budgets. This is your chance to get involved and really change lives.
 

 Speaker2: [00:03:48] All you have to do is basically do some of your January grocery shopping in advance. Instead of having to buy all the different ingredients, you'd need to make a great keto smoothie. You can choose a package here that fits your budget and have it delivered to you. Ready to go? Just add water and shake. That's it.
 

 Speaker1: [00:04:04] And if you could share the news about this campaign, that would be amazing too.
 

 Speaker2: [00:04:09] So go on then, get clicking and support our campaign. The sooner we hit our target, the sooner we can press. Go on ordering all the materials we need to make this idea a reality. You could be receiving your freshly made shakes as soon as mid-March.

 Speaker1: [00:00:07] Hey there. We're lecanto and we're revolutionizing the health of the world by creating innovative, sugar free products. We've created some chocolate bars. We've created some pancake mix and maple syrup. But we want to bring you a brownie mix that's actually going to be healthy for you and kick sugar out of your life. Because sugar is horrible. It causes cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and obesity, to name a few. So let's throw that over to Kevin now with our brownie mix. Thanks, Brandon. So typically what you're going to find in a sugar free natural brownie mix, which I don't know how they call it natural when you have artificial flavoring, artificial sweeteners like Splenda, artificial colors in in the product, those are usually going to be seeing in a sugar free brownie today. Also, some of the natural ones, they're going to be sweetened with some harsher type of sugar alcohols like maltitol or xylitol. And also they're going to have stevia typically. And stevia as we know has a bitter aftertaste.
 

 Speaker2: [00:01:07] So our lakanto brownie mix is not only gluten free, low carb and dairy free, it's also sugar free. It's sweetened exclusively with lakanto sweetener, so it's not going to have any bitter aftertaste. It's not going to give you crazy digestive problems, and it also tastes incredibly good, so it's perfect for someone who's just trying to be healthy. It's also perfect for your hardcore keto and paleo people or someone who has diabetes.
 

 Speaker3: [00:01:32] If you join us, you are promoting the sugar free movement by allowing tasty, delicious and nutritious alternatives. Become more readily available for yourself, your family, and the community. Hashtag sweet responsibly.",94.32,7,6,4.38,,10

Speaker1: [00:00:02] Hi Kickstarter, thanks for checking out my project. I'm Dave and I'm here to share with you something that I think is pretty sweet. About two years ago I needed some room for my other business, so I rented a retail space where I live in downtown Hillsboro, Oregon. I built a kitchen in the back and in the front. I decided to open up a chocolate shop and follow one of my passions through a lot of trial and error, customer feedback, and a lot of fun, we're going to focus on what I know we're doing really well and really uniquely. I've now been creating over 200 unique and delicious chocolate bars using some of the highest quality dried fruits, roasted and candied nuts, and amazing candy combinations to make really fun, delicious and unique flavors. Some examples are all the dried fruits and nuts you could think of, classic bars of turtles and s'mores and gummy bears. Some of the more unique stuff like peanut butter and jelly, popping cotton candy bars, matcha green tea, coconut curry, ghost pepper, Aztec bars, and a lot, lot more. We have a lot of dairy free, gluten free, as well as vegan friendly options. I'm here for your support in launching the business online.

Speaker1: [00:01:07] We need to order large quantities of this customized gift box that you're going to be able to have in a beautiful design. You can look below in the descriptions and see what it'll actually look like. You're going to be able to go online and order a four, eight, or 12 piece gift box customized for whatever your personal flavor is, or choose for some of the best sellers or more popular stuff that I've already selected. We also need to order larger chocolate tempering machines, as well as freezers and shipping equipment, so we can ship these in temperature controlled boxes nationwide year round. My goal is to provide amazing flavors of ethically sourced killer chocolate bars at a fair price and a fun, customizable gift box. We're also going to be donating a percentage of all of our profits to organizations that focus on sustainability, as well as a fair wage for all the cocoa farmers around the world. We're going to be taking feedback from all of our backers on seasonal, fun flavors for our stretch rewards. Let's do something really sweet together. Back to project.
